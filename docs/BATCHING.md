# Several requests at once (batch slots)

By default Strata serves **one request at a time**: the others wait in the server's queue. With `"parallel": N`
(the engine's `--batch N`, also spelled `--slots N`) the engine keeps up to N conversations open and decodes them
**together**: every verify window then carries one token of each conversation, so the dense weights, the shared
expert, the head and every routed expert two conversations share are read once per window for all of them.
Combined with a layer split across several GPUs and `--batch-groups`, the cards also work on different
conversations at the same time instead of waiting for each other.

It is opt-in and changes nothing when the options are absent (#465; the engine part is PR #559).

## Turning it on

One GPU: add `"parallel": 2` to the model's config (`strata-<model>.json`) and restart, or run setup with
`--parallel 2`. Setup recommends it only where it does not cost speed (below); any number you ask for is kept as
asked, with a note when it is more than setup would recommend.

```
"parallel": 2
```

With a layer split, the engine options go into the config's `args`:

```
"args": [ ..., "--batch", "8", "--batch-groups", "4", "--trim-stage-weights" ],
"layer_split": "12,24,36"
```

| Option | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| `"parallel": N` / `--batch N` / `--slots N` (2..8) | up to N conversations decoded together; more requests wait for a free slot. Each slot gets its own state (a session carved like the stage's own: GDN recurrence, QSA K/V and indexer, PLE history) on every GPU of the split. |
| `--batch-groups G` | with a layer split: the N slots in G groups that flow through the GPUs as a pipeline (GPU k runs one group while GPU k+1 runs another). G must divide N. 1 = all slots in one window, GPU after GPU. |
| `--trim-stage-weights` | with an **explicit** `--layer-split` (e.g. `12,24,36`, not `auto`): every GPU loads only the dense weights of its own layers instead of the whole model's (the same as `STRATA_STAGE_TRIM=1`, PR #639). The VRAM this frees goes to the expert cache. Useful without `--batch` too. |

The engine never refuses a count it cannot run: it says so in its log and runs what it can - at most 8 slots (a
window holds 8 rows), as many as fit in VRAM, or none (one request at a time) when not two fit. The server reads
the count the engine reports (`INFO batch_slots=N`), and `GET /v1/status` says it (`concurrency.serving`).

### What a slot costs, and what setup recommends

Every slot's session takes VRAM that the expert cache would otherwise hold: 0.56 GiB at a 32K context with 8-bit
KV, more with a longer context unless the KV cache streams (`--kv-resident`: then only the attention's 32K window
stays in VRAM, and each slot's whole KV cache takes pinned RAM - 1.6 GB at 128K). On a card whose experts mostly run
on the CPU, a batch also reads about as many distinct experts as the requests one by one (different conversations
route to different experts), so the gain is in **latency** (nobody waits for a whole answer), and a request alone
runs slower (the smaller expert cache): 11-24 % on a 12 GB card, see the measurements below.

So setup recommends `"parallel"` **only where the experts mostly fit in VRAM**: the expert cache (each card's VRAM
less ~5 GB, every card of a layer split counted) must still hold at least half of the model's experts beside the
slots, and the slots may take at most a fifth of it, up to 4 slots. With Q2_0 at 32K that is 3 slots on a 24 GB
card, 4 from 32 GB or on a split such as 2 x 16 GB; IQ3_S needs 32 GB or a split. Everywhere else (any 12 or 16 GB
card alone) it stays at one at a time and setup says: "parallel N reduces waiting for several users but costs
about 10-25% speed per request on this card". `--parallel N` is honoured as asked either way.

## How the server uses the slots

- **One request alone** runs on the usual solo path (verify windows with MTP drafts): the fastest single stream.
- **When a second request arrives**, the first is stopped (`STOP`) and continues in a batch slot with its prompt
  plus what it generated so far - the engine's prompt cache holds exactly that, so nothing is read again - and the
  new request is admitted next to it. A request in a slot decodes **without MTP drafts** (one token per window).
- **A request left alone in a slot** (the others finished, nobody waits) goes back to the solo path: the slot is
  stopped, the engine copies its sessions back and decodes with MTP drafts again (at most twice per request; with
  `--prompt-cache 0` it stays in the slot; `STRATA_PARALLEL_SOLO=0` turns it off). The draft layer's own K/V was
  built for another conversation then, but measured it accepted as many drafts (140 of 172) as a draft layer that
  read the conversation (140 of 173).
- **More requests than slots** wait for a free one (`/metrics` -> `live.slots` shows each slot: idle, reading or
  decoding, its tokens and tok/s; `live.running` the requests in flight).
- **Each admission** reads the request's prompt through the usual prompt path (prompt cache and conversation
  checkpoints included) and produces its first token there; the state is then copied into the slot. Admissions
  are taken one at a time, and **the slots decode between the prompt's chunks**: after each chunk (`--prefill`,
  2048-8192 tokens) they decode for half as long as the chunk took (`STRATA_BATCH_DECODE_SHARE`, default 0.5), so
  a long prompt slows the others down instead of stopping them. The chunks are the ones one uninterrupted read
  takes, so the prompt's arithmetic is unchanged.
- **A long prompt gives way to a short one** (#656's cooperative preemption): when a request with a prompt under
  half as long is waiting, the server sends `BYIELD`; at its next chunk boundary the long read stops, the part read
  so far is copied into a slot, the short request is admitted, and the long one then goes on from its slot with the
  same chunks (at most twice per request).
- **Each slot is a conversation cache.** A finished slot keeps what it holds (the prompt, the answer, and the
  checkpoint at the prompt's last turn boundary); the next turn of that conversation goes to that slot and the
  engine copies its state back (50-60 ms for a short conversation) instead of reading the history again - also for
  a client that drops the reply's thinking from the history (the checkpoint matches up to the new turn). A new
  conversation takes an empty slot, else the one used longest ago.
- Slots are assigned so that consecutive requests land in different pipeline groups (`--batch-groups`).
- A client that disconnects stops its slot (`BSTOP`); the others go on.

## Exactness

A batch row's arithmetic is the single-token window's, so with greedy decoding **every conversation of a batch
produces exactly the tokens it produces alone** - verified token by token for 8 concurrent conversations of 150
tokens, with and without the pipeline (`tools/batch_test.py`), and on one RTX 5070 for 4 conversations, for a long
prompt read while two others decode, for a prompt that gave way and went on, for a next turn continued from its
slot (from all it holds, and from its turn checkpoint without the reply's thinking), and for a request stopped in
its slot and continued on the solo path (`tools/batch_interleave_test.py`). These
settings make the comparison exact:

- `STRATA_IQ_MT_MIN=1` (the multi-token CPU expert kernels for every group, as for the solo path's own
  exactness tests: by default an expert's rows round differently alone than in a group, so the output depends on
  how many rows of a window share an expert - which differs between a batch and a request alone),
- `--pcie-frac 0`: the PCIe share of the missed experts is chosen per window from the window's misses, so the
  same expert can run on the GPU in one window and on the CPU in another, which rounds differently, and
- `--adapt-every 1000000` (the VRAM tier fixed), and `--no-prefill-borrow` while a prompt is read beside decoding
  slots: their windows then see the expert cache without the slots the prompt borrowed (those experts run on the
  CPU).

With the default settings the outputs stay coherent but drift apart after some tokens, as two solo runs whose
windows differ can. Measured on the RTX 5070 (Q2_0, 4 conversations of 200 tokens, `tools/batch_test.py` without
the settings above): one equal to its solo run, the others apart from token 0, 99 and 174 - the first token already
differed for one, because the adaptive VRAM tier had moved experts between the solo runs and the batch; all four
texts read as well as their solo runs.

Sampled requests (temperature, top_p, top_k, min_p, seed) are drawn row by row with the solo window's
counter-based draw (Philox(seed, position)).

## Limits (for now)

- Batch windows carry no MTP drafts: a conversation in a slot decodes one token per window (the solo path keeps
  its drafts, which is why a request alone is not put in a slot, and goes back to it when left alone).
- Repetition / frequency / presence penalties are not applied in batch windows.
- A prompt shorter than one chunk is read in one piece (the slots wait for it); a read gives way only at a chunk
  boundary, and not for pictures.
- Admissions are one at a time: two new long prompts are read one after the other.
- `--batch-groups` needs every stage on its own GPU; a pipelined slot is not kept as a conversation cache.
- The slot sessions take VRAM (above) and, with KV streaming, pinned RAM.

## Measured

One RTX 5070 (12 GB), Ryzen 5 7600, 64 GB DDR5, Q2_0, 32K context, through the HTTP server: C different requests
sent at once (an 800-word essay each, 256 tokens per answer, greedy, thinking off), median of 3 rounds:

| Concurrent | Setting | Total tok/s | vs one at a time | Per request tok/s | First token: median / last of the round |
| ---: | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | one at a time (default; what setup recommends on this card) | 74.3 | - | 83.6 | 0.4 s / 0.4 s |
| 1 | `"parallel": 2` | 67.3 | -9 % | 74.8 | 0.4 s / 0.4 s |
| 1 | `"parallel": 4` | 57.9 | -22 % | 63.8 | 0.4 s / 0.4 s |
| 2 | one at a time | 71.6 | - | 77.3 | 2.1 s / 4.1 s |
| 2 | `"parallel": 2` | 61.0 | -15 % | 32.6 | 0.5 s / 0.9 s |
| 2 | `"parallel": 4` | 54.6 | -24 % | 28.7 | 0.6 s / 0.7 s |
| 4 | one at a time | 70.7 | - | 79.6 | 6.0 s / 11.2 s |
| 4 | `"parallel": 2` | 61.2 | -13 % | 32.2 | 4.5 s / 9.3 s |
| 4 | `"parallel": 4` | 63.1 | -11 % | 16.9 | 1.0 s / 1.8 s |

On this card the slots buy **waiting time, not speed**: the fourth of four requests starts after 1.8 s instead of
11.2 s, but together they decode 11-24 % slower than one after the other, and a request alone loses 11 % (2 slots)
or 24 % (4 slots), because the slots' sessions (0.56 GiB each) come out of the expert cache and most experts run
on the CPU: a batch window over 4 conversations reads 24 CPU experts per layer against ~8 for one, so it costs about
what the 4 tokens cost one after the other (`strata batch:` in the engine log: 54 ms per 4-row window, ~20 ms per
1-row window). This is why setup leaves a 12 GB card at one at a time. Cards that hold most experts in VRAM, and a
layer split, are where the slots also add speed (below).

A 4-GPU layer split (4 x 16 GB, PCIe Gen3), IQ3_S, `--batch 8 --batch-groups 4 --trim-stage-weights`, through
the HTTP server, 400 tokens per answer, temperature 0.7 (PR #559):

| Concurrent requests | Per request | Total |
| ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | 123 tok/s (solo path) | 120 tok/s |
| 2 | 57 tok/s | 113 tok/s |
| 4 | 51 tok/s | 205 tok/s |
| 8 | 45 tok/s | 360 tok/s |

With the patches below on engine 0.1.38 and parking on, through the service: 8 requests at temperature 0 -> 369
tok/s, at 0.7 -> 358 tok/s.

`--trim-stage-weights` alone raised the share of experts held in VRAM on that machine from 76-85 % to 84-100 %
per card.

## Together with conversation parking

`--conversation-cache-mib N --conversation-cache-slots K` (DETAILS.md) works with the layer split too: a request
whose conversation was parked is restored on every stage before its admission, so an agent and its sub-agents, or
several chats that alternate, come back without reading their history again. Measured on the same 4-GPU split,
two long conversations alternating through the HTTP server: the first turns took 3.9 s and 5.7 s to the first token
(their prompts read), the follow-ups 0.53 s and 0.46 s.

## Testing

Four scripts drive a built engine or a running server; each exits non-zero on a failure. `serve/test_parallel.py`
tests the server's side with a scripted engine (no GPU).

| Script | What it checks |
| --- | --- |
| `tools/batch_test.py` | the same prompts alone (`GEN`) and together in the batch slots (`BGEN`): every slot's greedy tokens equal its solo tokens; prints the aggregate rate. `--batch-groups` in `--extra` tests the pipeline, `--keys "temperature=0.7"` the sampled rows. |
| `tools/batch_interleave_test.py` | a long prompt read while two slots decode, a prompt that gives way (`BYIELD`) and goes on, and a next turn continued from its slot: each equal to its solo tokens. |
| `tools/parking_test.py` | a follow-up to a conversation decodes the same tokens whether its state stayed live or came back from the parking cache (with a layer split: every stage's image). |
| `tools/early_close_test.py` | a client that stops reading a streamed answer early (alone, and with a second request running) does not leave its tokens to the next request (server). |

For exact comparisons pass `--pcie-frac 0 --adapt-every 1000000` (and the scripts set `STRATA_IQ_MT_MIN=1`):

```
python3 tools/batch_test.py --exe engine/strata --config strata-<model>.json --batch 8 --n 8 \
    --extra "--layer-split 12,24,36 --trim-stage-weights --batch-groups 4 --pcie-frac 0 --adapt-every 1000000"
python3 tools/batch_interleave_test.py --exe engine/strata --config strata-<model>.json \
    --extra "--pcie-frac 0 --adapt-every 1000000 --no-prefill-borrow"
python3 tools/parking_test.py --exe engine/strata --config strata-<model>.json \
    --extra "--layer-split 12,24,36 --conversation-cache-mib 8192 --conversation-cache-slots 4 --pcie-frac 0"
STRATA_KEY=<key> python3 tools/early_close_test.py http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

## Engine protocol (`--serve`)

On top of `GEN` / `GENI`:

| Line | Direction | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `BGEN <slot> <max_new> [keys] <ids>` | in | read the prompt (as `GEN 1`), then continue in `<slot>` |
| `BGENI <slot> <max_new> [keys] <file> <ids>` | in | the same with images |
| `BADM <slot> <1/0>` | out | after the admission's `DONE`: 1 = it continues in the slot, 0 = it ended |
| `BT <slot> <id>` | out | a token of that slot |
| `BDONE <slot> <generated> <stop/length/cancel> <ms>` | out | the slot is free again (it keeps its conversation) |
| `BSTOP <slot>` | in | end that slot at its next window |
| `BYIELD <slot>` | in | the prompt being read gives way at its next chunk boundary; its part read waits in `<slot>` (the admission's own, or a free slot for a solo request) |
| `YIELDED <slot> <tokens>` | out | before the `DONE cancel` of a read that gave way: the request is sent again later and goes on from there |
| `INFO ... batch_slots=N` | out | the slots the engine runs (only with `--batch`) |

`tools/batch_test.py` drives the engine directly: the same prompts alone, then together, compared token by token,
and the aggregate rate.
