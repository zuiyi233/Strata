# Unsloth UD-Q4_K_XL (experimental)

**Experimental.** Setup offers it from engine 0.1.32 ([below](#setup)); the manual workflow after that section works
with engine 0.1.31 or newer. Validated on one PC: Windows 10, an RTX 5070 (12 GB), 64 GB of RAM and an AVX-512 CPU,
on 2026-10-01.

The target is Unsloth's 4-bit quantization of the same model the other packs use:
[unsloth/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-GGUF, `UD-Q4_K_XL`, revision `38bb39e`](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-GGUF/tree/38bb39ee97821de2c9009abb7e93950eec396e66/UD-Q4_K_XL).
"UD-Q4_K_XL" is a mix of formats, not Q4_K everywhere: the routed experts are Q4_K (Q5_K in layer 2) for gate/up and
Q5_1 (Q8_0 in layers 2, 4, 30, 46, 47) for down; the token embedding, the output head, the attention and shared-expert
projections and the PLE key are Q8_0; the 28.8 GB PLE table is IQ4_NL. The routed experts are 71.7 GiB, about twice
the 3-bit models'.

## Setup

`START-HERE.bat --setup` (Linux: `./setup.sh --setup`) and choose **Qwen3.8-Flash-Next (Unsloth)**, marked
`[experimental]`; or directly:

```sh
START-HERE.bat --setup --family unsloth --model UD-Q4_K_XL
```

What setup does differently for this model:

- It needs 48 GB of RAM or more (with less it asks, default no; `--model UD-Q4_K_XL --yes` installs it anyway) and
  engine 0.1.32 or newer (checked before anything is downloaded), and an NVIDIA
  GPU: it has not been run on AMD cards (its prompt kernels for the Q4_K / Q5_K experts are NVIDIA-only), so with
  `--backend hip` setup says so and asks before the download (#429; `--model UD-Q4_K_XL --yes` tries it). One GPU
  by default: the RAM budget below has no layer split (the engine refuses `--resident-budget-gib` with one). No
  images (the vision encoder is not wired to this file yet) and no experimental speed projection (not tested with it).
- Several GPUs (#498): when the RAM holds the GGUF files and 24 GB more (~135 GB of RAM) and two or more cards can
  share it, setup asks (one GPU stays the default; `--gpus 0,1` takes the split). The split runs **without** the RAM budget: all 77 GB of experts are loaded into RAM from the GGUFs at
  start, the files pass through the OS file cache while they load, and the config gets `"gpu": [0, 1]` and
  `"layer_split": "auto"`. Measured on 2x RTX 3090 with 165 GiB (#498): decode 31 tok/s on one card with the budget,
  64-78 tok/s split (55 tok/s at a 128K prompt), with `MemAvailable` never under 68 GiB. With less RAM, `--gpus`
  keeps one GPU and says so, and `START-HERE.bat --gpus 0,1` on an installed UD-Q4_K_XL stops with the reason
  (it used to keep the budget, and the engine exited with code 2).
- It downloads the four shards below from the pinned revision `38bb39e` (resumable, like the other models), then
  checks each one's size and SHA-256 against the table below; the check takes a few minutes once and is remembered
  in the file's finish mark. A file with the wrong hash is deleted, so the next run downloads it again.
- It packs with `--compat-bf16` and never writes `experts.bin` (`--low-ram` does not apply).
- The RAM budget is the PC's RAM less 24 GB: `--resident-budget-gib 40` on 64 GB, at most all 71 GiB of experts on
  96 GB or more. From a 64K context up, where the KV cache moves to RAM, its size comes out of the budget. Setup's
  `--resident-budget-gib N` sets another one (a bigger one is kept, with a note on what it risks).
- It recommends an 8K context on a GPU under 14 GB (every GB of KV cache is a GB less of cached experts).

## The files

Four shards, 111,334,654,784 bytes (111.3 GB) together. Shard 1 holds only the metadata; layer 11's down projection is
in shard 2 and its gate/up in shard 3, which this engine handles (`native_experts.txt` v4).

| File | Bytes | SHA-256 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-UD-Q4_K_XL-00001-of-00004.gguf` | 10,946,624 | `4448186216b3af4cc558bbce2c3213f01608f8f8b2e5267a9767971dd3ec8082` |
| `Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-UD-Q4_K_XL-00002-of-00004.gguf` | 49,859,583,136 | `3f342f1c1580473f1ee94ddd5b28206e8c07a70fa1a366f59d1d6c922919a6c9` |
| `Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-UD-Q4_K_XL-00003-of-00004.gguf` | 49,376,141,504 | `56758f40269cad5cd9b0d3d6fbae0f40f6d5be6de49e4ab392dbe83157d9cbd3` |
| `Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-UD-Q4_K_XL-00004-of-00004.gguf` | 12,087,983,520 | `753bda48b98ba4f1636134a90a967de1b2d3908a236c026e464777342e53510a` |

Keep the four files together in one folder under these names (the engine finds shards 2-4 from shard 1's name; a
missing shard is an error that names it). Setup checks them itself; by hand, check them before packing
(`sha256sum -c`, or `Get-FileHash` on Windows).
Hugging Face snapshot symlinks work if you pass the snapshot's file name, not the hash-named blob it points to.

## What it needs

| | |
| --- | --- |
| Disk | 111.3 GB for the four files, 1.4 GB for the pack, ~6 GB for the MTP draft layer if you have none yet. **No `experts.bin`**: the engine reads the experts from the GGUF files in place. An NVMe SSD matters: the experts that fit neither VRAM nor the RAM budget are read from it for every token. |
| RAM | 64 GB measured. The RAM budget (below) holds the most-used experts; the rest come from the SSD through the OS file cache. |
| GPU | 12 GB measured (RTX 5070): after the weights, the draft layer and the buffers, the expert cache held 1,280 of the 24,576 experts (3.7 GiB) at 4K context. |

## The pack (by hand)

Build Strata (or install 0.1.31+), then, from the repository root, with gguf-py from the pinned llama.cpp
(setup installs it; `STRATA_GGUF_PY` can point to its `gguf-py` folder):

```sh
.venv/bin/python tools/iq_pack.py \
  --gguf /path/to/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-UD-Q4_K_XL-00001-of-00004.gguf \
  --out packs/ud-q4_k_xl --compat-bf16
```

About 30 seconds. It writes `index.txt`, `dense.bin` (1.4 GB), `native_experts.txt`, the tokenizer, `conversions.json`
and `compat-bf16.json`. **`--compat-bf16` is required**: this file stores 195 small projections (the hyper-connection
up/down matrices, `output_hc_*` and the PLE value) as Q8_0, while the engine reads them as BF16. Without the flag the
packer refuses and writes nothing; with it, they are dequantized and rounded to BF16 (nearest-even). Do not add
`--experts-bin`: it would write a 77 GB copy of the experts that this mode does not need.

## The numbers: what is native and what is converted

The routed experts, the token embedding, the output head, the attention and shared-expert projections, the PLE key and
the PLE table are used as the GGUF stores them (the engine has GPU kernels and CPU (ggml) paths for Q4_K, Q5_K, Q5_1 and
Q8_0). The small tensors the engine reads as floats are converted, and `conversions.json` lists every one with its
source/destination type, method, whether it is exact, the largest absolute error and the source bytes' SHA-256:
264 F32 tensors (routers, injections, SSM gates) whose values are already BF16's are stored as BF16 exactly; the 195
Q8_0 projections above are rounded to BF16 (largest absolute error 0.0144, in `hc_ffn_up`); the PLE convolution (F32)
is narrowed to F16 when the engine loads it (largest error 3e-8). That is the compatibility Unsloth's file needs; it is
not the original BF16 checkpoint. The output matches llama.cpp's on the same file:
[Quality](#quality-against-llamacpp-on-the-same-file).

## The MTP draft layer

The draft layer is the base model's, the same one the other packs use. If setup installed Strata, you have it
(`mtp/rt` in `Strata-data`). Otherwise build it as [docs/ORCA.md](ORCA.md#preparation) shows (`tools/mtp_fetch.py`,
`tools/mtp_pack.py`, `tools/mtp_rt.py`, then copy `data/draft_vocab.bin` to `mtp/rt/`).

## The server

Save as `strata-ud-q4_k_xl.json` at the repository root (or next to setup's other `strata-*.json`), with `/path/to/`
pointing at **shard 1**. `--ple-gguf` is not needed: the engine finds the shard that holds the PLE table
(`per_layer_token_embd.weight`, shard 2) by name. `--resident-budget-gib` turns on the mapped mode with a RAM budget
(it implies `--mmap-experts`).

```json
{
  "exe": "engine/strata.exe",
  "args": [
    "--pack", "packs/ud-q4_k_xl",
    "--native", "/path/to/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-UD-Q4_K_XL-00001-of-00004.gguf",
    "--resident-budget-gib", "40",
    "--expert-profile", "data/expert-profile.bin", "--expert-cache", "auto",
    "--prefill", "auto", "--spec", "4", "--spec-min-p", "0.5",
    "--mtp", "mtp/rt", "--max-context", "8192"
  ],
  "cwd": ".",
  "tokenizer": "packs/ud-q4_k_xl/tokenizer",
  "model_name": "qwen3.8-flash-next-ud-q4_k_xl",
  "log": "strata-ud-q4_k_xl.log",
  "host": "127.0.0.1",
  "port": 8080
}
```

```sh
.venv/bin/python -m serve.server --engine strata --config strata-ud-q4_k_xl.json --port 8080
```

(`engine/strata.exe` is setup's engine on Windows; a self-built one is `build/strata`.) The expert profile is the base
model's (`data/expert-profile.bin`); it ranks the same 48 x 512 experts and decides which ones the GPU cache and the RAM
budget take first.

**Choosing the RAM budget N:** your RAM minus 20-24 GB (the OS, the engine itself, the 126 MB router copy, and room for
the OS file cache that serves the rest). On 64 GB, 40. The engine clamps a budget larger than the RAM it finds free
(minus 4 GB and a 256 MiB margin) and says so; before #403's fix such a clamped budget could then fail the start. Everything above N comes from the SSD for every token, so N is the setting that matters
most; a bigger budget was faster in every measurement (24 / 32 / 40 GiB). When the driver page-locks the whole budget
(24 GiB did on this PC, 32 and 40 did not), the GPU also computes a share of the misses over PCIe, as in the resident
low-RAM mode; `STRATA_RESIDENT_PIN=0` keeps the budget locked only (the CPU then computes every miss).

**Context:** measured at 4K. The KV cache takes VRAM from the expert cache, so a longer context makes decoding slower;
8K is a reasonable start on 12 GB. `--kv int8` halves the KV cache's VRAM.

## What to expect (RTX 5070 12 GB, 64 GB RAM, Windows, one short greedy prompt)

| RAM budget | Greedy output | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 24 GiB | 5.1-5.2 tok/s (2 runs, before the routing prefetch below) | 2.2 GB read from the SSD per verify round (~3.5 tokens) |
| 40 GiB | **7-8.5 tok/s** (6 runs: 6.7-8.6, mean 7.9) | 1.1 GB read from the SSD per verify round, ~0.33 GB per token |

- The first answer comes about 60 s after the engine starts (mostly loading: the RAM budget is copied from the GGUF
  files at start). A 30-token prompt then took 5-6 s.
- Long prompts (engine 0.1.32): a 16K prompt is read at **160 tokens/s** (15,873 tokens in 99 s; 0.1.31: 57 tokens/s,
  273-282 s). Reading a prompt streams every expert once per 4K chunk, and the third of them outside the RAM budget
  come from the SSD (~35 GB per chunk), so the prompt path now reads them with 32 threads and up to 128 blobs in
  flight when the experts are read from the GGUF in place (`STRATA_STAGER_THREADS` / `STRATA_STAGER_RING` override
  it; 4 and 16 before, still the default for every other model). Between the chunks, the 28.8 GB PLE table's rows
  take ~5 s per chunk.
- An engine compiled with `-DSTRATA_MMQ_KQUANTS=ON` multiplies the Q4_K / Q5_K / Q5_1 experts of a prompt with
  llama.cpp's MMQ kernels (as the other models' formats always are) instead of dequantizing them to FP16: 4x less GPU
  time for those products, but on this PC the prompt waits for the SSD either way (29 s per 4K chunk with or
  without). Off in the released engine: it loads every kernel at start, and these took 1-3 expert slots of VRAM from
  every model.
- The speed varies from run to run (6.7-8.6 tok/s at 40 GiB for the same prompt), with what the OS file cache holds.
- For comparison, IQ3_S (all its experts in RAM) writes ~53 tok/s on the same PC ([the speed tables](DETAILS.md#speed-measured)).
- Where the time goes (`--stats` on the command line): at 40 GiB about 550-750 ms of each verify round (3.5 tokens) is
  reading experts from the SSD, ~75 ms the CPU's expert kernels, ~13 ms the GPU.

## Quality: against llama.cpp on the same file

Strata and llama.cpp (the pinned commit `3cf0325`, a CPU build reading the GGUF memory-mapped) were given the same
token sequences, and at every position each wrote its 20 most likely next tokens with their log-probabilities: Strata
through its verify windows (`STRATA_LOGPOS` with `STRATA_LOGPOS_TOPK=20`), llama.cpp from `llama_get_logits_ith` over
one batch. Strata ran with the recommended settings (RAM budget 40 GiB, the MTP draft layer on, greedy,
`--adapt-every 100000` so the expert cache does not move during the run). Per position: whether the most likely token is the same (argmax
agreement), how many of the 5 / 10 most likely tokens both have, the KL divergence (llama.cpp's distribution against
Strata's, over llama.cpp's top 20 plus one bucket for the rest), and the perplexity of the sequence under each.

| Token set | Positions | Argmax agreement | Top-5 / top-10 overlap | KL | Perplexity Strata / llama.cpp |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Code: Strata's greedy answer to a coding prompt (an LRU cache in Python, 56-token prompt) | 400 | **99.0%** | 95.6% / 95.3% | 0.0008 | 1.067 / 1.070 |
| Thinking: Strata's greedy answer to a reasoning puzzle (with thinking, 55-token prompt) | 324 | **97.5%** | 96.2% / 96.4% | 0.0016 | 1.107 / 1.106 |
| After a 16K prompt: Strata's greedy continuation (256 tokens) of the 16,384 real-text tokens below | 256 | 90.2% | 88.1% / 89.3% | 0.039 | 1.619 / 1.623 |
| Real text after a 16K prompt: the last 510 tokens of 16,384 tokens of this repository's docs and code | 510 | 91.2% | 88.3% / 89.9% | 0.035 | 4.27 / 4.29 |
| The same 511 positions with only 512 tokens before them | 511 | 89.2% | 86.0% / 86.3% | 0.061 | 8.99 / 8.87 |

For comparison, [eddoursul/Strata](https://github.com/eddoursul/Strata) reported 98.2-99.3% (code), 95.6-95.8%
(thinking) and 97.7% (after a 16K prompt) for the same file against llama.cpp on an RTX 3090.

**Where they differ:** at near-ties. Grouped by llama.cpp's own gap between its two most likely tokens, Strata picks
the same token at every position of the code and thinking answers where that gap is 0.2 or more (695 of 695) and at
every position after the 16K prompt where it is 0.5 or more (144 of 144 in the continuation, 254 of 254 in the real
text; 50 of 54 and 117 of 121 between 0.2 and 0.5). Text after a long document has many more near-ties than a short
answer (58 of the continuation's 256 positions and 135 of the real text's 510 have a gap under 0.2, against 13 of the
code answer's 400), which is why its agreement is lower. It is not the long context itself: the same real-text
positions after only 512 tokens agree a little less (89.2%), and the perplexities match within 3% in every set. For
scale, Strata's own greedy run and its teacher-forced rerun of the continuation pick different tokens at 6% of the
positions (93.8% the same: other window sizes, other experts in VRAM), the same kind of near-tie flips. The 16K
prompts were read by Strata's batched prompt path (15,872 tokens), the rest through the verify windows. These numbers
are the FP16 prompt path's (the released engine's); with the MMQ prompt path (`-DSTRATA_MMQ_KQUANTS=ON`, above) the
continuation after the 16K prompt agrees at 92.2% (KL 0.029, three runs, identical).

To repeat it: Strata's side is `STRATA_LOGPOS=<file>` with `STRATA_LOGPOS_TOPK=20` (engine 0.1.32) on a serve
engine with `--short-read` covering the positions to compare; llama.cpp's side was a short program over
`llama_decode` / `llama_get_logits_ith` writing the same top 20 per position.

## Opt-ins and switches (environment variables)

| | |
| --- | --- |
| `STRATA_LOOKAHEAD=0` | Turns off the routing-aware prefetch (on by default in this mode): while the CPU works on a layer, a thread applies the next layer's router to this layer's input and asks the OS to read the predicted experts' pages. Pages only, the answers are the same. About half of the SSD reads were predicted; mean +14% (6.9 -> 7.9 tok/s). `STRATA_LOOKAHEAD_K` sets the experts per token (default 10). |
| `STRATA_KQ256=1` | Multi-token AVX2 kernels for the Q4_K / Q5_1 / Q8_0 experts. Bit-exact with ggml's, but measured no faster, so off. |
| `STRATA_PARTIAL_PIN=1` | Registers the hottest part of the RAM budget (up to `STRATA_PARTIAL_PIN_GIB`, default 24) with the GPU driver, so the GPU computes a share of the misses over PCIe (`--pcie-frac`). Measured no faster on this PC, and it changes the numerics of those experts (GPU kernels instead of the CPU's), so off. |
| `STRATA_FETCH_THREADS=N` | Threads that read the experts from the GGUF while it answers (default 8; 16 was no faster). The prompt path has its own: `STRATA_STAGER_THREADS` (default 32 here) and `STRATA_STAGER_RING` (128). |

## UD-IQ4_XS (setup from 0.1.39, #621)

Unsloth's `UD-IQ4_XS` at the same revision is in setup too, as a regular choice (not experimental; the Unsloth
family's first size and its default): `START-HERE.bat --setup --family unsloth --model UD-IQ4_XS` (engine 0.1.38 or
newer). It sits between IQ3_S and UD-Q4_K_XL: its routed experts are IQ3_S gate/up (IQ4_XS
in one layer) with IQ4_NL downs (Q8_0 in five layers), 59.5 GB of them; the dense side (Q8_0 projections, the IQ4_NL
PLE table, a Q6_K head) is UD-Q4_K_XL's. Three shards, 93.7 GB:

| File | Bytes | SHA-256 |
| --- | ---: | --- |
| `Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-UD-IQ4_XS-00001-of-00003.gguf` | 10,946,624 | `5ce89370720f8bf90890f439361282104c1aa1482d4013bb9a50923e758e71a4` |
| `Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-UD-IQ4_XS-00002-of-00003.gguf` | 49,835,229,856 | `577a38a2392b40ca2193cea502e1d92f60b8cd370675d308e0ec21885d9daaa7` |
| `Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-UD-IQ4_XS-00003-of-00003.gguf` | 43,836,407,744 | `d4634e6d84f0ebb0940be15c90d3790bf6464e3dea3a1cddc567dc0e83ad8833` |

Setup treats it like UD-Q4_K_XL (the list above): the same RAM budget (your RAM less 24 GB; at most all 55 GiB of its
experts, so a PC with ~80 GB of RAM or more holds all of them), the pack with `--compat-bf16`, no `experts.bin`, one
GPU by default. It does not ask on AMD: its experts' formats have prompt kernels there too. Images are an option (asked,
off by default; NVIDIA): the image path has no restriction for this pack, which uses the original model's image
encoder; not yet run with images.

What is known so far: it packs and runs on a Strix Halo (AMD gfx1151, 128 GB unified memory), where prompts read at
~820 tokens/s at 8K and 64K and the answers passed the retrieval checks at 8K and 64K. It has **not** been measured on
NVIDIA yet; please report what you see. One fidelity note that applies to every `--compat-bf16` pack (UD-Q4_K_XL too):
the pack rounds the file's Q8_0 hyper-connection projections to BF16, and on the Strix Halo that rounding put
perplexity 6-9% above llama.cpp's on the same file (teacher-forced, short context). Reading the Q8_0 values instead
closes most of that gap; it is measured on AMD only and not in this release.

## Scope and validation

- UD-Q4_K_XL and UD-IQ4_XS at revision `38bb39e` are targeted. Other Unsloth quantizations use formats this engine may
  not have kernels for; the engine checks every layer's formats at start and refuses an unsupported one by name.
- Tests: the packer's synthetic 4-shard and conversion tests (`.venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s tools -p
  test_iq_pack.py`); CTests `gguf_split_test`, `expert_layout_test`, `native_expert_parity_*` (the three real expert
  format pairs against ggml-cpu, the Q5_1 min term, Q8_0 rows), `prefill_mmq_kquant_test` (with `-DSTRATA_MMQ_KQUANTS=ON`: the
  prompt path's MMQ products for Q4_K / Q5_K / Q5_1 / Q8_0 against ggml's dequantized weights); the in-place mode against `experts.bin` on the Coder
  (identical tokens and logits).
- Real runs: greedy answers to a coding prompt (correct) at every budget and setting above, identical across them;
  the same tokens as llama.cpp at 97.5-99% of the positions of short greedy answers and 90-91% after a 16K prompt,
  differing mostly at near-ties (above). Not yet: sampled decoding, long conversations. Please report what you see.
