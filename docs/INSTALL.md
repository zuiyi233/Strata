# Installing Strata

Everything about installing, starting, updating and configuring Strata, on Windows and Linux, with an NVIDIA or an
AMD graphics card. The short version is in the [README](../README.md#install); an AI coding assistant can do all of
this for you with [AI_SETUP.md](AI_SETUP.md).

## What you need

| | |
| --- | --- |
| **GPU** | **NVIDIA** RTX 20, 30, 40 or 50 series, **12 GB VRAM or more** (8 GB runs, slowly). Measured on an RTX 5070 and an RTX 3090; RTX 20 (Turing, since 0.1.27) was tested by a contributor on an RTX 2070. **AMD** Radeon RX 7900 XT / XTX, RX 9070 / 9070 XT and Radeon AI PRO R9700 (validated), RX 7800 XT / 7700 XT and RX 9060 XT (validated by their owners), RX 6800 / 6900 series (community-reported), with 12 GB of VRAM or more. See [AMD cards](#amd-cards). |
| **RAM** | Enough for the size you pick ([which model](MODELS.md#pick-by-ram)); **64 GB** runs every size. A big GPU makes up for less RAM - the [low-RAM mode](MODELS.md#a-big-graphics-card-and-little-ram). |
| **CPU** | x86-64 with AVX2 (any Intel/AMD desktop CPU from the last ~8 years). AVX-512 (Ryzen 7000/9000) is a bit faster. Older CPUs without AVX2 are experimental and slow: [Older CPUs](#older-cpus-experimental). |
| **Disk** | ~70-80 GB free for the model, ~6 GB for the MTP layer (+1 GB with images). **Q2_0 on an AVX-512 CPU** also writes a one-time ~40 GB copy of its experts for the fast CPU kernel. On Linux with an AMD card, ROCm takes ~10 GB more when setup installs it. An NVMe SSD is strongly recommended: it makes the first start much faster. |
| **OS** | Windows 10/11, or Linux (Ubuntu 22.04/24.04 get everything installed automatically). |
| **Driver** | **NVIDIA:** a current driver, version 580 or newer ([nvidia.com/drivers](https://www.nvidia.com/drivers) or the NVIDIA App). **AMD:** on Linux the kernel's amdgpu driver (no ROCm install needed); on Windows a current AMD Software: Adrenalin Edition driver ([amd.com/support](https://www.amd.com/en/support)). |

The driver is the only thing you install yourself. Everything else - Python, the engine, the model - is set up for
you the first time: Python 3.12 if you have none (for your user account, no admin), a private Python environment in
`.venv/`, the Strata engine, the model and the MTP draft layer. On NVIDIA it uses the ready-made engine for RTX
20/30/40/50 and NVIDIA's CUDA libraries from pip (~0.4 GB); if no ready-made engine fits your PC, it offers to install
the build tools (Visual Studio Build Tools + CUDA Toolkit on Windows, `build-essential` + CUDA on Ubuntu) and compiles
the engine for your GPU (asks first; 20-40 minutes once). More: [details](DETAILS.md#before-you-start).

## Windows

1. [Download this project](https://github.com/Niko1221/Strata/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and unzip it (or
   `git clone` it).
2. Double-click **`START-HERE.bat`**.
3. Answer a few questions - or just press Enter each time for the recommended choice ([the questions](#setups-questions)).

Then it downloads everything (the model is ~70 GB, so the first time takes a while - you can stop and it picks up
where it left off) and **starts the model**. Your browser opens the Strata app at `http://127.0.0.1:8080`.

> **While the model starts, your PC can be slow or stop responding for 1-3 minutes** (longest the first time): Strata
> loads 35-55 GB into your RAM and locks part of it for the graphics card. That's normal - wait, and don't close the
> window. The window tells you what it is doing.

**Next time**, just double-click `START-HERE.bat` again: it starts right away (30-90 s to load the model), nothing is
downloaded twice. Close its window to stop the model. `SETUP.bat` (the same as `START-HERE.bat --setup`) installs
another model or changes the settings. Starting Strata from Task Scheduler at logon needs two task settings, or the
start is 24x slower: [Running it at startup](DETAILS.md#running-it-at-startup-task-scheduler).

## Linux

```bash
./setup.sh
```

The same questions, the same automatic install (it uses `sudo apt` for Python and, only if it has to compile, for
the build tools), and the same start: `http://127.0.0.1:8080`. Later runs of `./setup.sh` (or `./run-<model>.sh`)
start the model directly; `./setup.sh --setup` installs another model or changes the settings. Other distributions,
WSL and compiling: [details](DETAILS.md#linux).

## AMD cards

The steps are the same as with NVIDIA: `START-HERE.bat` on Windows, `./setup.sh` on Linux. Setup finds the Radeon
card and chooses the AMD (HIP) engine by itself on a PC with no NVIDIA card Strata can use; `--backend hip` chooses
it on a PC that has both. Supported cards: RX 7900 XT / XTX (gfx1100), RX 7800 XT / 7700 XT (gfx1101), RX 9060 XT
(gfx1200), RX 9070 / 9070 XT and Radeon AI PRO R9700 (gfx1201), and the RX 6800 / 6900 series (gfx1030). Integrated
Radeon GPUs are listed as not supported.

On Linux setup uses a system ROCm 7 when there is one, or installs ROCm into `.venv` from AMD's wheels (~10 GB, no
sudo), and compiles the engine on your PC for the card (10-20 minutes, once; it needs a C++ compiler and git:
`sudo apt install build-essential git`). Several AMD cards share the model with `--gpus`, as on NVIDIA.

What differs from NVIDIA for now: pictures are read by the image encoder on the CPU (`--vision cpu`, 10-30 s per
picture), `--calibrate` is NVIDIA-only, and Unsloth's 4-bit model needs an NVIDIA card. Measurements per card, the
build by hand and the tuning tables: [AMD_HIP.md](AMD_HIP.md).

## Two or three cards

**Two or three NVIDIA cards?** Just run `START-HERE.bat`: it lists your cards, says which ones Strata can use, and
asks whether to share the model across them (recommended when two can). An install made on one card asks once at
its next start. Or choose yourself: `START-HERE.bat --gpus 0,2` (both, remembered), `--gpus all`, or `--gpu 0` (one
card, this start only). Each card keeps the experts of its own layers, and prompts flow through the cards in a
pipeline: on an RTX 5080 + RTX 3090 prompts were read 18-20% faster than on the 5080 alone, decoding on par.
Every card must be an RTX 20 series or newer with 8 GB or more. See [MULTI_GPU.md](MULTI_GPU.md).

**Several AMD cards:** setup takes one card (the one with the most VRAM, or `--gpu N`) unless you name more:
`--gpus 1,0` splits the model's layers across them, the first one the main card (numbers as setup lists them). A
split pays only when no single card holds the model's experts ([AMD_HIP.md](AMD_HIP.md#rdna4-gfx1201)).

## Docker (Linux)

The same idea, in a container (NVIDIA cards).

1. Host: Docker with the [NVIDIA Container Toolkit](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html)
   and a driver **580 or newer** (CUDA 13.0).
2. Build (this compiles the engine into the image, so the container never compiles):
   `docker build -t strata .`
   `docker build -t strata --build-arg CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=89 .` builds for one card only (faster).
   The default covers RTX 30 (86), RTX 40 (89), RTX 50 (120) and A-series (80); a card outside that
   set needs a rebuild with its own arch. Add `--build-arg BUILD_VISION=0` to skip the image encoder.
3. Run (the first start downloads the ~70 GB model, then starts; later starts go straight to serving):
   `docker run --rm --gpus all -p 8080:8080 --ulimit memlock=-1 -v strata-data:/data strata`

   The setup choices are env vars: `-e MODEL=IQ2_XS -e FAMILY=qwen -e CONTEXT=32768 -e VISION=no`
   (or `MODEL=Q2_0|IQ3_XXS|IQ3_S`, `FAMILY=swift|coder`; the defaults above are the recommended ones).
   `-e VISION=cpu` keeps the image encoder on the CPU. `-e KV=int8|q4_0|k8v4` picks the KV cache
   precision; `k8v4` is INT8 K with 4-bit V and keeps its KV in VRAM from 64K up.
   Only the model files, the prepared pack, the MTP layer and the install config live in the
   `strata-data` volume; the engine is part of the image. Switching between models already on the
   volume needs no setup pass: `-e MODEL=Q2_0 -e FAMILY=coder` picks that model's config. Add
   `-e REINSTALL=1` only to change settings for a model already set up (context, vision, KV, host,
   api_key, LOW_RAM), since those are recorded in its config.
   Strata loads 32-62 GB into RAM. `--gpus all` on a host with two usable cards takes both: the
   layer split is setup's recommended default ([MULTI_GPU.md](MULTI_GPU.md)), and a volume
   set up for one card switches to the pair on its first start there. Pin one card with `-e GPU=0`,
   or name them with `-e GPUS=0,2` and where the later card's layers start with `-e LAYER_SPLIT=18`.
   A memory limit needs `-e LOW_RAM=on`, which maps the model's experts from the pack instead of
   keeping them in RAM: setup.py measures the host's RAM, not the container's limit, so it cannot
   see a cap. LOW_RAM runs on one card unless `GPUS` names several (then the experts the cards do not hold are
   read through the OS file cache, which can fill the RAM during long prompts).
   The server listens on `0.0.0.0:8080` by default; set `-e API_KEY=<secret>` before exposing the port
   to a network. The image has a `HEALTHCHECK` on `/health`, so `docker ps` shows the container
   healthy once the model is loaded, and `GET /v1/status` says what it is running.

## Older CPUs (experimental)

Strata's ready-made engine needs AVX2 (Intel Haswell 2013, AMD Zen 2017 or newer). Since 0.1.39 an older CPU - AVX
only (Sandy Bridge / Ivy Bridge, Xeon E5 v1/v2, AMD Bulldozer) or SSE4.2 only (Nehalem / Westmere, Xeon X5600) - runs
as an **experimental** build that setup compiles on that PC. Run setup as usual: it says the CPU has no AVX2, warns
that this is experimental and slow, and compiles the engine (10-20 minutes, once; Windows needs the Visual Studio Build
Tools and the CUDA Toolkit, which setup offers to install). It does not stop. The ready-made engine still refuses such
a CPU, and says so.

What differs in that build (`STRATA_ISA_FLOOR=avx` or `none`, chosen from the CPU):

- ggml-cpu is compiled for AVX or SSE4.2 instead of AVX2, and the CPU's share of the experts runs on its kernels.
  Strata's own AVX2 / AVX-512 kernels stay in the program but are used only on a CPU that has them.
- Only the i-quant models' packs run (every model setup installs on such a CPU); the AVX-512 Q2_0 pack does not.
- Speed: the GPU part is unchanged and the CPU part is slower, so a GPU with more VRAM (more experts cached there)
  helps most. With the older paths forced on a Ryzen 5 7600 + RTX 5070 and the expert cache held at 1500 slots, greedy
  decode went from 26 to 11-17 tok/s with the AVX build and to 3.5-3.8 tok/s with the SSE4.2 build (Coder and IQ3_XXS,
  10 prompts each, one run). An old Xeon with DDR3 will be slower than these.
- Untested on a real old CPU by us. It was checked here by forcing the older paths on a Ryzen 5 7600
  (`STRATA_FORCE_ISA=avx` or `sse`): the answers were sane and passed the engine's checks, but not the same token for
  token as the normal build (ggml-cpu rounds the CPU experts differently, as the AVX2 kernel does from the AVX-512
  one). Contributors ran earlier versions of the same approach on a Xeon E5-2680 (2.87 tok/s with a GTX 1080 Ti)
  and on Xeon E5-2687W / X5690 machines.
- AMD cards: Linux only (setup compiles the AMD engine there anyway); NVIDIA on Windows and Linux.
- Two-socket Xeons: memory on the other socket is slow; keep the RAM on one CPU if you can.

By hand: `cmake ... -DSTRATA_ISA_FLOOR=avx` (or `none`) builds it; `STRATA_ISA_FLOOR=avx` set for setup builds it on
any PC (to try it). Problems and results on real hardware are welcome as GitHub issues.

## Updating

**`UPDATE.bat`** (Linux: `./update.sh`) updates Strata without starting the model - for when the GPU is busy with
something else, or you just want the new version ready. In a `git clone` it runs `git pull`, then does what
`START-HERE.bat` does before a start: the engine (a new ready-made one when the new version needs it; on Linux a
compiled engine is compiled again when its source changed), the Python packages, and each installed model's settings
and draft subset. The model files are not touched (at most a new engine is downloaded) and no question is asked.
Close the model's window first (a running engine cannot be replaced); start the model later with `START-HERE.bat` as
usual. In a copy that was downloaded as a zip it says to download the new zip (below): it cannot fetch new files
itself.

Or by hand: download the new version and unzip it anywhere (or `git pull`), then run `START-HERE.bat` (Linux:
`./setup.sh`) in it. The model files are kept in a `Strata-data` folder next to your Strata folder, so a new copy
finds them and sets itself up the same way - nothing big is downloaded again. On Linux after a `git pull`, setup
compiles the engine again when its source changed (a minute or two for the changed files); if that compile fails, it
says so and starts the engine you had.

## Where things are stored

- **Your chats: only in your browser.** The Chat tab keeps the conversation, its settings and the API key you typed
  in the browser's local storage (`strata.*` keys) - not on the server and not in the Strata folder. Pictures are not
  kept, only their names. Another browser or a private window starts empty; clearing the site's data deletes them.
- **How the model starts:** `strata-<model>.json` in the Strata folder (context, GPUs, host, API key, ...), written
  by setup; next to it `run-<model>.bat` / `.sh`, the log `strata-<model>.log` and, when you use "Use for other
  apps too", `strata-<model>.shared-settings.json`. Running setup again for the same model (another context, say)
  rewrites the keys setup writes (`exe`, `args`, `port`, `gpu`, `host`, `api_key`, `vision`, ...) and keeps the
  ones you added (`sampling`, `mcp_servers`, `mcp`, `cors_origins`, ...); the earlier file is kept as
  `strata-<model>.json.bak` (0.1.39). Engine options you added to `"args"` by hand are not carried over: setup names
  them, and you add them again.
- **The model files** (`models/`, `packs/`, `mtp/`, 70-120 GB): in **`Strata-data` next to the Strata folder**, or
  wherever `--data-dir` put them.
- **Where that data folder is:** `%APPDATA%\Strata\settings.json` on Windows, `~/.config/strata/settings.json` on
  Linux ([details](DETAILS.md#before-you-start)).
- **The program itself:** `.venv/`, `engine/` and `third_party/` in the Strata folder.
- **Where github.com cannot be reached:** a build from source downloads llama.cpp's source (ggml, gguf-py) from
  GitHub at the commit `LLAMA_CPP_COMMIT` in `setup.py` names. Put that commit's tree in `third_party/llama.cpp`
  yourself (from a mirror or another PC) and setup uses it instead (#585).

## Setup's questions

- **Which model and size?** The original, Swift 1.5, the Coder or Unsloth's 4-bit, and Q2_0, IQ2_XS, IQ3_XXS or
  IQ3_S - see [which model](MODELS.md).
- **How much context?** How much text it can keep in mind at once (it suggests one for your card). 384K and
  512K (experimental) extend the model past its trained 262K by rope scaling - the setup turns it on itself (yarn and a
  covering factor; `--rope-scaling`/`--rope-scale` override) ([details](DETAILS.md): "Context extension past
  262K").
- **Images?** Whether it should also read pictures. The image encoder (0.9 GB) runs on the GPU (0.1-0.5 s per
  picture, ~1.4 GB of VRAM kept free for it) or on the CPU (10-30 s per picture, nothing on the GPU); with AMD cards
  on the CPU for now. [Details](DETAILS.md#images-vision).
- **Experimental speed projection?** Off unless you say yes - [read what it does](DETAILS.md#experimental-speed-projection-experimental-off-by-default)
  first. It changes how the model answers, and only the original model offers it.

With `--yes` setup takes the recommended answer to every question.

## Tuning for your PC

Every PC is different: `START-HERE.bat --calibrate` (Linux: `./setup.sh --calibrate`) measures a few engine settings
on yours and keeps the fastest (about 5-10 minutes; on an RTX 5070 with a Ryzen 5 7600 it made the Coder 7% faster).
It keeps a setting only when it is more than 3% faster, and the result is remembered per PC and model, so updates
keep it. NVIDIA cards for now. [What it measures](DETAILS.md#double-click-start-herebat).

## Options without questions

```
START-HERE.bat --setup                          install another model, or change context / images
SETUP.bat                                       the same (double-click it)
START-HERE.bat --model IQ2_XS --context 32768 --vision yes --yes     no questions
START-HERE.bat --gguf-dir D:\models\IQ2_XS       use GGUF files you already have
START-HERE.bat --data-dir E:\Strata-data         keep the model files somewhere else
START-HERE.bat --port 8081                      another port
START-HERE.bat --gpu 1                          another GPU (setup picks the one with the most VRAM)
START-HERE.bat --gpus 0,2                       several GPUs sharing the model
START-HERE.bat --vram-reserve-mib 2048          leave 2 GB of VRAM free for other programs (remembered)
START-HERE.bat --no-browser                     do not open the chat page when the model is ready (remembered;
                                                --browser undoes it)
START-HERE.bat --setup --backend hip            the AMD engine on a PC that also has an NVIDIA card
START-HERE.bat --setup --host 0.0.0.0 --api-key <secret>     reachable from other devices, with a key
START-HERE.bat --calibrate                      tune the engine for this PC (about 5-10 minutes), then start
START-HERE.bat --check                          only check this PC
```

**Leaving VRAM for other programs (#493):** Strata fills the graphics card's free VRAM with experts (the expert cache)
and leaves `--vram-reserve-mib` MiB free: 700 by default. For a game, a 3D program or another model beside it, leave
more: `START-HERE.bat --vram-reserve-mib 2048` (Linux: `./setup.sh --vram-reserve-mib 2048`) writes it into the
model's `strata-<model>.json` and starts it; at setup (`--setup --vram-reserve-mib 2048`) it goes into the new config.
By hand: add `"--vram-reserve-mib", "2048"` to the config's `"args"` list and restart. The expert cache is then that
much smaller, so answers can be a little slower. The engine sizes its cache from the VRAM free when it starts: what
another program already holds then is left alone anyway; the reserve is room for what it takes later.

**An AMD card that also drives a Linux desktop (#560 #516):** with the default reserve the expert cache fills the
card, and when the desktop (the compositor, a browser, a new app) needs more VRAM, the amdgpu driver moves GPU memory
to system RAM, which the model's experts already fill: the OOM killer then ends the desktop session (KWin, plasmashell)
or the compositor fails ("Failed to pin framebuffer"). `./setup.sh --vram-reserve-mib 3072` fixed it in both reports
(about 2.3 GB fewer experts in VRAM, a few % of speed). Setup and the server window say so on such a PC.

**A card under 8 GB (#496):** when the default reserve leaves the expert cache too little room, the engine lowers the
reserve (down to 300 MiB) until it fits, and warns if the card then ends nearly full. If the start stops with "no VRAM
is left for the expert cache", that log line says how much is short; an 8K context and `--draft-vocab en` at setup
free the most.

**Model files downloaded by hand, or from a mirror (#495):** setup's step 5 prints the folder it expects them in
(`Strata-data\models\<SIZE>\`, e.g. `Strata-data\models\IQ3_XXS\`): put them there with their original names, or
point setup at them with `--gguf-dir`. To let setup download from a Hugging Face mirror itself, set `HF_ENDPOINT`
first (Windows: `set HF_ENDPOINT=https://hf-mirror.com`, Linux: `export HF_ENDPOINT=https://hf-mirror.com`): the same
pinned revisions and checks apply, and the MTP draft layer comes from there too.

On Linux the same options go to `./setup.sh`. `START-HERE.bat --help` lists them all. The server's own settings
(sharing the GPU with games, MCP tools, CORS, API keys, the API itself) are in the [details](DETAILS.md#using-it).
