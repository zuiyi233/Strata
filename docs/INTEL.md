# Strata on an Intel Arc

Strata's engine is CUDA. On an Intel Arc it runs as **Strata's own engine, ported to SYCL** (`sycl/`, the
section "The engine itself on Intel" below), behind the same Strata server: OpenAI and Anthropic APIs, streaming,
tool calls, MCP and the web app all unchanged. llama.cpp's SYCL backend is the comparison point in the tables (it
runs the same GGUF at about a third of the speed).

Everything Intel-specific lives in `sycl/`; no shared file of upstream's is changed, so upstream merges stay clean.
`sycl/setup_intel.py` and `sycl/serve/server_intel.py` wrap upstream's `setup.py` and `serve/server.py` from
outside.

Written for and measured on an **Arc Pro B70 (32 GB)** running the Coder (IQ1_M) on Ubuntu 24.04, in a
PCIe 3.0 x8 slot (the card trains at Gen3 x8 there; it can do Gen5 x16).

## What you get (2026-10-01)

| | NVIDIA (Strata engine) | Intel Arc, Strata SYCL port | Intel Arc, llama.cpp |
|---|---|---|---|
| models | all four | the Coder IQ1_M; the original IQ2_XS too (experts beyond VRAM in the host mirror: 58-64 tok/s) | the Coder (fits VRAM) |
| model files | the same GGUFs | the same GGUFs + a native pack | the same GGUFs |
| where the model lives | experts in RAM, hot ones on the card | every expert in VRAM (`--stream-experts`: no host copy), shard 2's lookup table read from the SSD by row | all of shard 1 on the card, shard 2 paged from disk |
| RAM needed | 32-64 GB | little (23 GB is fine) | little (23 GB is fine) |
| decode, Coder IQ1_M | 44-51 tok/s on an RTX 5070 | **78.2 tok/s** (19-token prompt, 256 greedy tokens), **75.7** after a 2,184-token prompt, 69 after 40K, 66.6 after 128K, 55.9 after 256K; 48-72 through the API | 23-25 tok/s |
| prompt reading | ~1,870 tok/s | **790 tok/s** at 2,184 tokens, 1,117 at 40K, 888 at 128K, 757 at 256K | ~150 tok/s (424 at 105K) |
| speculative decoding (MTP) | yes | yes (the base checkpoint's draft layer; 70-85% of drafts accepted on code) | no |
| images | yes | not yet | not yet |
| context | up to 262K | 256K measured, 56 tok/s decode there (`--kv-resident`: the KV in pinned host memory, the attended window in VRAM) | 131K measured ceiling |

Decode speed with speculative decoding depends on the text: code drafts well, prose less so (see "Speed depends
on the text"). The SYCL numbers are greedy runs of the engine (as in "How to run it by hand" below, 256 new
tokens) on engine 0.1.31-sycl (2026-10-01; 0.1.32-0.1.38-sycl reproduce them exactly);
"Decode round 2" below lists what each change bought.

## Setup

Build the engine and its runtime image first ("How to build it" below), then:

    python3 sycl/setup_intel.py [setup.py's options, e.g. --model IQ2_XS --context 32768 --port 8085]

This is upstream's `setup.py`, run with the Intel steps swapped in (it imports setup.py and replaces those steps;
setup.py itself is unchanged). The model choice, download, pack, tokenizer, MTP draft layer and the context and KV
questions are setup's own. What changes:

- **GPU check:** the Arc is found in sysfs (vendor 8086 under `xe` or `i915`) and offered through setup's AMD
  path. That is the path that builds locally and has no images.
- **Engine step:** it uses the SYCL build (`build-sycl-aot/strata`, run in the `strata-sycl-dev` image by
  `sycl/serve/strata-sycl.sh`) instead of compiling CUDA or HIP.
- **RAM rule:** this does not apply. The CUDA engine keeps every expert in RAM; the port streams them from the
  GGUF into VRAM (`--stream-experts`), so RAM only decides the KV streaming. `--check` lists what fits by VRAM.
- **The config:** it uses the container's paths and `"backend": "sycl"`. The VRAM reserve is 1,024 MiB up to
  32K and 2,048 MiB with 4,096-token prompt chunks above that. KV streaming (`--kv-resident 32768`) is on from
  64K up when the RAM holds the KV. A `model_switcher` or `sampling` block from an earlier config is kept.
  `run-<model>.sh` starts `sycl/serve/server_intel.py`.

If a future `setup.py` drops a step this relies on, it stops with a message instead of writing a wrong config.
The models, packs and checkout must sit under the folder `strata-sycl.sh` mounts at `/work` (the one above the
checkout, or `STRATA_SYCL_ROOT`).

Then `run-<model>.sh` (or `sycl/setup_intel.py` again) starts the model. The first start of a 30 GB model
takes about two minutes. `--port N` and `--host 0.0.0.0` work as in upstream's setup.

## Things that matter on this GPU

- **`SYCL_CACHE_PERSISTENT` must be 0.** The persistent JIT cache segfaults on Xe2 during the first
  compile. The start script sets it; if you run llama-server by hand, do too.
- **The whole model goes on the card** (`--n-gpu-layers 999`), except `per_layer_token_embd.weight`,
  the single 28.8 GB tensor of shard 2. `--override-tensor per_layer_token_embd=CPU` keeps it in host
  memory, mmapped and paged from the SSD by row, which is how the model's authors serve it. Host RSS
  stays around 2 GB.
- **Thinking.** The model reasons before it answers. Strata's web app has the setting; for an API
  client, put `{"reasoning_effort": "none"}` in `strata-<model>.shared-settings.json` next to the
  config, or send `chat_template_kwargs: {"enable_thinking": false}` per request. Without one of
  those a short `max_tokens` is spent entirely inside the think block and the answer looks empty.
- **`/health` says 503 while loading**; the server polls `/props` instead.

## How much context fits

The architecture keeps this small: only every fourth layer is full attention (12 of 48); the other
36 are gated-delta-net layers with a fixed-size recurrent state that does not grow with context.
Per token, the 12 attention layers keep 2 KV heads x 256 x (K + V) at q8_0, plus the
sparse-attention indexer's keys. **Measured: about 20 KiB per token** (VRAM grows 0.6 GB per 32k
of context with everything else unchanged).

| context | VRAM in use, model loaded | headroom on 32 GB | status |
|---|---|---|---|
| 32,768 | 28.4 GB | 3.5 GB | measured, the default |
| 65,536 | 29.0 GB | 2.9 GB | measured, loads |
| 98,304 | 29.6 GB | 2.3 GB | measured, loads |
| 131,072 | 30.3 GB | 1.5 GB | **measured, the practical ceiling**: a 104,798-token prompt (79% of the window) read in 247 s at 424 tok/s, then answered |
| 163,840 | ~31.0 GB | ~0.9 GB | not attempted: under the 1.2 GB safety margin |
| 262,144 | ~32.6 GB | none | **does not fit - asking for it took the host down** |

**Do not ask for more than fits.** On this driver a GPU allocation past VRAM does not fail: the xe
driver evicts buffers into host RAM, the kernel runs out of memory, and the machine livelocks until
its hardware watchdog resets it. A 262K request did exactly that on 2026-09-29, and llama.cpp's own
"failed to fit params" check fired too late to prevent it. Compute the KV size first and leave
1.5 GB free.

Prompt reading gets faster with size, because the work batches better: ~150 tok/s on a 2.7k-token
prompt, 424 tok/s on a 105k-token one. So a full 128k window costs about five minutes to read,
not fifteen.

## The engine itself on Intel: the SYCL port (`sycl/`)

Everything above runs the model through llama.cpp. This is the other half: Strata's own engine - the 50 CUDA
kernels and the host code that drives them (streams, events, graph capture, pinned memory) - built for the
Arc with oneAPI. It is a migration of the tree, not a new backend: the engine has no backend seam to slot
into.

**Layout.** `sycl/src` and `sycl/include` mirror the tree and hold only the files the port changes; the
SYCL build (`sycl/CMakeLists.txt`) takes every other source from the original location. No upstream file
is edited. `sycl/include/dpct/` is the vendored SYCLomatic helper library, so the port builds without the
migration tool.

**How it was made, so it can be redone.**

1. `sycl/tools/Dockerfile` - the dev image: the llama.cpp SYCL image plus SYCLomatic (`dpct` 2025.3),
   ninja, and the CUDA 12.8 headers that `sycl/tools/get-cuda-headers.sh` pulls out of NVIDIA's pip wheels
   (dpct parses CUDA; it needs the headers, not the toolkit).
2. `sycl/tools/migrate.sh` - writes a compilation database for the 86 CUDA-touching translation units and
   runs dpct over them. 85 migrate; dpct reports no line it could not migrate, and about 1,400 advisory
   notes.
3. `sycl/tools/fixups.py` - what dpct got wrong or could not do, as an idempotent script with a reason per
   item. The ones that mattered:
   - CUDA's null stream means the default stream; dpct turned it into a null `sycl::queue*`. Every
     stream cast now goes through `strata::q_of()` (`sycl/include/strata/sycl_queue.hpp`).
   - `__ldg((const float*) p)` came out as `*p`, reading one byte of a float scale (two sites, s_gemv).
   - `__fadd_rn(a, b ? c : d)` lost its parentheses (two sites).
   - the ggml lookup tables were threaded through kernel parameters with the wrong table per template;
     they are plain `static const` arrays read from device code, as ggml-sycl does.
   - helper headers renamed since dpct 2025.3 (`entangle`, `chunked_partition`), graph introspection and
     `cudaGraphUpload` (no SYCL equivalents), `%globaltimer` (the stage profiler reads zeros).
4. `sycl/tools/build.sh` - configure + build with icpx inside the image. Two compiler flags are load-bearing:
   `-fp-model=precise` (icpx defaults to a fast FP model) and `-cl-fp32-correctly-rounded-divide-sqrt`
   for the device compiler - the Arc's fp32 divide is not correctly rounded by default (OpenCL allows
   2.5 ulp), and Strata's quantizers are byte-exact against ggml through `amax / 127`. Measured: without
   it `quantize_act_parity` has 303k mismatches, with it none.

**Where it stands (2026-09-29).** The whole tree builds and links: the `strata` binary and 22 kernel
parity tests. On the B70, 19 of the 22 pass byte-for-byte or within their tolerances; the other three
need model fixtures (`iq_parity`, `ple_parity`) or the tensor-core kernel below (`qsa_prompt_attn`).

| parity test | result |
|---|---|
| bf16_gemv, cvec, dequant_s2, elementwise, gdn, gr, kv_q4, kv_q8, kv_stream, qsa, quantize_act, rope, router_top10, s2_gemv, s2_gemv_q8, s_gemv, s_gemv_q8k, sampler, shared_expert | pass |
| iq_parity, ple_parity | need fixtures (a `logs/iq_fixture` directory, a Q2_0 shard) |
| qsa_prompt_attn_parity | needs the tensor-core kernel (below) |
| kv_hybrid_parity (0.1.27, hybrid K8V4 KV) | appends, gathers and attention pass; its last step is that same tensor-core kernel |

**The engine end to end (2026-09-29, later the same day).** It generates. Prompt "Write a Python function
that returns the n-th Fibonacci number", greedy, 64 tokens:

> `<think>` The user wants a Python function that returns the n-th Fibonacci number. Let me consider the
> options: 1. **Recursive approach** - Simple but O(2^n) time complexity, very slow for large n. 2.
> **Iterative approach** - O(n) time, O(1) ...

Measured on the same card, same 2,185-token prompt, 64 greedy tokens (AOT build, `--spec 2`,
`--no-prefill-borrow`), against llama.cpp's SYCL build serving the same GGUF:

| | llama.cpp SYCL | Strata SYCL port |
|---|---|---|
| prompt reading | 138-319 tok/s | **560 tok/s** (693 at 2,000 tokens, 180 at 300) |
| decode, suffix drafter only (`--spec 2`) | 24.2-26.0 tok/s | 20.2-20.8 tok/s |
| decode with the MTP draft layer (`--spec 4 --mtp`) | - | **42.7 tok/s** at the 2,185-token context (81% accepted, 2.9 tokens/round); 45.3 on a short prompt |

Prompt reading is where Strata's design pays (oneMKL GEMM over dequantised experts, the whole model on
the card). Decode is at ~80%: a speculative round costs ~53 ms whatever its size and the suffix drafter
is accepted 9% of the time, so nearly every round yields one token; `--spec 4` (16.9 tok/s) was worse
than `--spec 2` (20.8) for that reason. The kernels themselves run at 130-160 GB/s of weights on a card
that streams 600 GB/s (`sycl/probe/bw.cpp`, incompressible data) - the same class llama.cpp reaches -
and five variants of the hot Q6_K matvec (lanes per row, rows per warp, unroll, 16-byte loads, software
pipelining; `mmvq_bench`) all landed in that band. The draft source was the lever: the base
Qwen3.8-Flash-Next checkpoint's MTP layer (`tools/mtp_fetch.py fetch`, `mtp_pack.py --experts q2_0`,
`mtp_rt.py`; 4.9 GB downloaded, 809 MiB of VRAM) drafts for the Coder fine-tune at 87% acceptance:
3.4 tokens per 53 ms round, 45 tok/s, the same greedy tokens. The `mtp.cpp` path ran on the first try
under the same flags.

Without AOT the runtime JIT-compiles every kernel on first use, ~47 s the first time a process runs;
`SYCL_CACHE_PERSISTENT=1 SYCL_CACHE_DIR=<dir>` keeps that across runs (15 MB).

How to run it by hand (a greedy test run, the way every number in this section was measured; inside the
`strata-sycl-dev` image, AOT build in `build-sycl-aot/`):

```
STRATA_VERIFY_DEVICE_PLAN=1 STRATA_VERIFY_NO_HOST=1 \
build-sycl/strata --pack <iq pack> --native <shard1> --ple-gguf <shard2> \
    --expert-profile data/expert-profile-coder.bin --expert-cache auto --stream-experts \
    --prefill auto --spec 4 --spec-min-p 0.5 --max-context 8192 --tokens <ids> --max-new 64 --greedy
```

- `--stream-experts` (this port): no resident host copy of the experts; every one of the 12,288 goes from
  the GGUF into the VRAM cache through a small staging ring (`GgufExpertSource`). Upstream needs 32 GB of
  RAM for this model; with the flag the engine runs on 23 GiB.
- `STRATA_VERIFY_DEVICE_PLAN=1`: the GPU plans each layer itself (upstream's E-6; off by default there).
- `STRATA_VERIFY_NO_HOST=1` (this port): the host waits for the whole window graph instead of per-layer
  rings. Only valid with every expert resident, which is the case on a 32 GB card.
- `--no-prefill-borrow`: the prompt path must not lend expert slots (a lent expert is served from the host
  behind a flag the GPU does not see reliably here; long prompts hung without it).

What the port had to get right beyond compiling (each is an entry in `sycl/tools/fixups.py` or a flag):

- **Host-mapped flags.** Strata's decode is a GPU/CPU handshake through host-mapped memory. `volatile`
  device loads do not bypass the caches on Intel; system-scope atomics do, and they are the only thing
  measured to work (`sycl/probe/doorbell.cpp`, six variants). Host-to-device visibility *during* a kernel
  stays unreliable on this platform, which is why the all-resident path waits for the window instead.
- **Bounded spins.** A device spin that never sees its flag is not a hang of one process: the xe driver
  times the queue out and resets the GT node by node - a window graph has 2,400 - and the card stays
  wedged until a reboot (twice). Every spin is capped (`kSpinMax`).
- **32-lane sub-groups.** The kernels are written for warps; dpct pinned 134 of 289 launches, the rest
  would run at Xe2's default 16 (`-fsycl-default-sub-group-size=32`).
- **Synchronous copies.** `cudaMemcpy` blocks; dpct's default-queue `memcpy` did not wait. With the
  streaming ring that filled the expert cache from overwritten buffers: non-deterministic residuals, NaN by
  layer 5. Found with the per-layer residual ladder (`STRATA_VERIFY_DEBUG=1` prints R after every layer).
- `native_expert_parity` hand-ported: the GPU native expert kernel matches ggml's float reference on real
  IQ1_M rows (rel 1.1e-2, the same class as the CPU path).

Profiling: `sycl/tools/Dockerfile.unitrace` builds the dev image with Intel's unitrace; `unitrace -d` around
the engine plus `sycl/rank_kernels.py` gives device time per kernel. `mmvq_bench` and `native_expert_parity
NATIVE_BENCH=1` time the two hot kernel families in isolation (warm the clocks first: a 5 ms run measures
the ramp, not the kernel).

**After the 0.1.25-0.1.27 merge (2026-09-30, same card, same flags, AOT).** Fibonacci prompt (19 tokens),
64 greedy tokens: decode 46.5 tok/s (85% of drafts accepted). The 2,184-token prompt: 566 tok/s prompt,
38.3 tok/s decode (77% accepted on that text); the draft layer's prompt pass is now upstream's batched one
(38.6 ms for 2,184 tokens, from 105 ms for 19 before it). Parity: 19 of 22, byte-exact `quantize_act` back.

**Speed work, 2026-09-30 (after the 0.1.27 merge).** What moved the numbers, measured on the B70 with the
same prompts as above (outputs identical before and after each change):

| change | effect |
|---|---|
| every window graph and the drafter's graphs captured at load (`STRATA_WARM_GRAPHS=0`: as before) | the first request no longer pays 250-290 ms of captures |
| the commit graph left running while the drafter's round runs on its own queue (`Verifier::commit(wait=false)` + `commit_finish`) | decode 38.3 -> 43.0 tok/s at the 2,184-token context, 46.5 -> 49.8 short |
| upstream 0.1.29 merged (GDN recurrence pipelining, the block-scores read, sampler) | 2,184-token prompt 765 -> 792 tok/s, decode at that context 43.1 -> 45.2 |
| the draft layer's batched prompt pass takes prompts under 64 rows (it fell back to per-6-token graphs) | its prompt cost on 19 tokens 106 -> 16 ms |
| one device module per kernel (`-fsycl-device-code-split=per_kernel`) | the first launch in the prompt path (the embedding gather) 245 -> 1 ms |
| the expert dequant writes each thread's run of FP16 values as one vector store (it wrote them one 2-byte store at a time) | dequant per expert 0.085 -> 0.030 ms; prompt 496 -> 575 tok/s at 2,184 tokens, 720 -> 841 at 8,000 |
| SWAR sign compare/subtract in the expert dots, a local-memory resident-plan kernel, a split-K fused down kernel (bit-identical to the single-token one) | parity-clean, no measurable decode change; kept |
| the PLE row reader's default queue depth 16 -> 64 blocking O_DIRECT threads (`STRATA_IO_THREADS`; 128 and 256 change nothing: the drive tops out near 85k IOPS on the 27k random 4 KB reads a 2,184-token prompt needs) | the rows of that prompt 466 -> 330 ms |
| a short first prompt chunk (`STRATA_PREFILL_FIRST`, default 256 tokens) so the GPU starts while the remaining rows are still being read | 2,184 tokens: 711 -> 765 tok/s, 8,000: 857 -> 986; time to first token about 150 ms less. The chunk boundary moves rounding in the expert GEMMs, so a long greedy continuation can diverge late (token 45 of 64 on the test prompt) |

Draft policy sweep (2,184-token prompt, 128 tokens): windows of 6 (`--spec 4`) at 41.6-43.5 tok/s; `--spec 2`
33.6, `--spec 6` 35-37; `--spec-min-p` 0.3-0.7 within noise. Profiles (unitrace, `strata-sycl-dev:metrics` with
Intel's metrics libraries and `dev.xe.observation_paranoid=0`): the expert dot kernels are ALU-bound (77% XVE
active), the dense projections memory-latency bound (92-128 GB/s at 84-93% occupancy), a decode round is 80-85%
kernel time and ~5 us of launch gap per node over 2,400-2,600 nodes.

**XMX.** oneMKL's FP16 GEMMs already run on the XMX units (30-60 TFLOP/s in `xmx_gemm_bench`); the prompt path is
bound by the dequant that feeds them, not by the products. Two joint_matrix kernels were written and are correct
but lose to the existing paths on this card, so both stay opt-in: `xmx_gemm_iq` (a fused dequant + GEMM straight
from the quantized rows, 4-5x slower than dequant + oneMKL) and `qsa_prompt_attn_xmx` (the port of the mma.sync
prompt attention; `qsa_prompt_attn_parity` passes at 1e-6 of scale, 3x slower than the FP32 fallback per chunk;
`STRATA_PROMPT_ATTN_XMX=1`). Where the prompt time goes now (2,184 / 8,000 tokens): dequant 28% / 27%, GEMMs
22% / 20%, the per-layer host grouping 9.5% / 9%, attention 7% / 14%, embeddings + PLE rows 13% / 5%.

A trap worth knowing: with a native pack `--prefill-until N` does not feed the rest of the prompt through the
token loop (it is skipped for native packs), so the tokens after N are dropped and the model free-runs. Compare
output tokens between paths, never only timings.

**An 80,000-token prompt (2026-09-30).** Where the time goes changes completely at this scale:

- **The VRAM plan.** `--expert-cache auto` fills the card down to `--vram-reserve-mib` *before* the KV state
  (about 1 GB in INT8 at 81,920 cells) and the prompt chunk buffers (about 2 GB at `--prefill 8192`) exist. With
  the 1,536 MiB default that put 30.95 of the B70's 32.6 GB in use, the driver started migrating buffers and the
  run never finished. `--max-context 81920 --kv int8 --vram-reserve-mib 3072 --prefill 4096` peaks at 28.8 GB.
  (80k ids also exceed Linux's 128 KB single-argument limit: `--tokens-file`.)
- **Streamed experts.** The reserve costs cache slots (10,348 of 12,288 at 3 GB), and the prompt path streams the
  missing experts from the GGUF for every chunk. Two port bugs sat on this path and are fixed: the stream plan
  held `GgufExpertSource::blob()` pointers across ~1,900 reads of a 512-slot ring (so blobs were overwritten
  before they were copied: the 75 s / 1,065 tok/s measured first was computed partly with the wrong experts), and
  the stream-all walk hangs on this card in its first large chunk (the copy engine stops on a barrier). The stager
  threads now read the blobs themselves, and the port uses the per-layer routed-only walk (`STRATA_PREFILL_RING=8`
  upstream, the port's default; `STRATA_PREFILL_STREAM_ALL=1` restores the other for debugging).
- **Correct result: 80,000 tokens in 101 s = 790 tok/s.** GPU time: expert down GEMM 26.0 s, attention 15.4 s,
  dequant 12.7 s, QSA block selection 9.3 s (0.2 s at 8k: it scans every block of the context per query), gate/up
  GEMM 8.9 s, gather 6.1 s, the per-layer grouping sync 5.2 s, GDN recurrence 4.8 s. The PLE rows are free at this
  scale (97.6% row-cache hits).
- **Decode after such a prompt, and the fix.** Without lending cache slots to the prompt path (`--no-prefill-borrow`,
  which the port used from the start) the reserve evicts ~1,900 experts for good and decode after the prompt runs at
  2 tok/s. Borrowing lends ~940 slots to the prompt path and refills them in about a second afterwards: 80,000
  tokens in 75 s = **1,062 tok/s, decode 35-40 tok/s** after it, at `--vram-reserve-mib 2048 --prefill 4096`.
  It costs ~1 s on short prompts (2,184 tokens: 610 vs 792 tok/s), so the port borrows by default only above a
  32K context (`--prefill-borrow` / `--no-prefill-borrow` decide explicitly).

**Long contexts (2026-10-01, engine 0.1.32-sycl, setup's flags: `--kv-resident 32768 --vram-reserve-mib 2048
--prefill 4096`, the prompt path borrowing cache slots - the default above 32K).** Same text repeated to length,
then 256 greedy tokens:

| context | KV | prompt | decode after | peak VRAM | experts in the host mirror |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 128K | int8 | 888 tok/s (144 s) | **66.6 tok/s** | 29.9 GB | none |
| 128K | q4_0 | 848 tok/s (151 s) | 62.8 tok/s | 29.7 GB | none |
| 128K | k8v4, KV in VRAM | **1,006 tok/s** (127 s) | **66.8 tok/s** | 30.7 GB | 103 (0.2 GB) |
| 256K | int8 | 757 tok/s (338 s) | **55.9 tok/s** | 30.2 GB | none |
| 256K | q4_0 | 737 tok/s (347 s) | 51.7 tok/s | 30.0 GB | none |
| 256K | k8v4, KV in VRAM | 823 tok/s (311 s) | 52.2 tok/s | 30.9 GB | 865 (1.7 GB) |

Borrowing keeps every expert in VRAM (the prompt buffers live in lent cache slots, refilled after the prompt).
Without it (`--no-prefill-borrow`) the buffers keep their own VRAM and ~1,000-2,300 experts move to the pinned host
mirror: the prompt is 2-5% faster, decode after it 10-23% slower (0.1.31 without borrowing: 128K int8 934 / 59.5,
q4_0 887 / 53.4, k8v4 1,026 / 54.4; 256K int8 784 / 48.7, q4_0 763 / 43.2, k8v4 838 / 42.3 tok/s).

KV streaming (`--kv-resident`) keeps the whole KV in pinned host memory and only the attended window in VRAM, so
the KV pushes no experts out; setup.py turns it on from 64K up and keeps INT8 (the faster of the
two at every size here). Without it the KV pushes experts out and decode after the prompt fell to 4-9 tok/s at
128K-256K (2026-09-30). `--kv k8v4` does not support streaming yet: setup keeps its KV in VRAM, which pushes up to
more experts out; those come from the pinned host mirror over PCIe (planned item 2), so decode holds at 42 tok/s at
256K (it was 3.8 before the mirror). k8v4 reads prompts fastest (no streaming copies) and works through the FP32
attention fallback (its dedicated prompt kernel is the XMX one below).

**XMX prompt attention v2.** 64-cell chunks, vector-packed K^T and V, hi+lo Q in one accumulator per scale group,
one accumulator update per chunk: 1.4-1.5x faster than v1 and correct in all modes (`qsa_prompt_attn_parity`,
and `kv_hybrid_parity` passes completely with it), but still ~2x slower than the FP32 fallback (13.4 vs 5.5 ms per
chunk, INT8, 32K context). This attention is gather-bound: each query position selects its own ~2,000 cells, so
the K/V fetch dominates and only 12 of the 16 matrix rows are real heads. Opt-in: `STRATA_PROMPT_ATTN_XMX=1`
(64-cell chunks, 120 KB of local memory) or `=32`.

**XMX v2 in the full matrix, and why a grouped kernel is not next (2026-09-30).** With `STRATA_PROMPT_ATTN_XMX=1`
(stage timing on, ~8-10% overhead) the long prompts run 23-33% slower than with the FP32 attention: 128K int8 666 vs
960 tok/s, k8v4 596 vs 983; 256K k8v4 506 vs 752, int8 536 vs 718 (q4_0 does not use the XMX kernel). The obvious
fix, gathering the union of neighbouring positions' cells once, depends on how much their selections overlap.
Measured on the last chunk of an 80K prompt (first QSA layer, `STRATA_DUMP_SEL=<file>`): the union of 8 consecutive
positions is 3.3x one position's 2,051 cells (16: 5.1x), and only 12% of a selection is shared by all 8. Grouping
would cut the K/V gather to ~40% but multiply the arithmetic by 3-5x: at best 5-8 s of an 80K prompt. Not built.

**Serving the port (2026-09-30).** `serve/server.py --engine strata` runs the SYCL engine unchanged through
`sycl/serve/strata-sycl.sh`, an `exe` that starts the binary inside the oneAPI runtime image with the serve pipes
attached (paths in the config's `args` are the container's, the data root mounted at `/work`). A config:

```json
{"engine": "strata", "exe": "<repo>/sycl/serve/strata-sycl.sh",
 "args": ["--pack", "/work/pack", "--native", "<shard 1>", "--ple-gguf", "<shard 2>",
          "--expert-profile", "data/expert-profile-coder.bin", "--expert-cache", "auto", "--stream-experts",
          "--prefill", "auto", "--spec", "4", "--spec-min-p", "0.5", "--mtp", "/work/mtp/rt",
          "--max-context", "32768", "--kv", "int8", "--vram-reserve-mib", "1024"],
 "sampling": {"temperature": 0.6, "top_p": 0.95, "top_k": 20, "repetition_penalty": 1.05}, ...}
```

Measured through the OpenAI API with those sampling defaults: 36 tok/s decode on a first turn, 33 on a follow-up
(which reuses the conversation's cached prompt), against 24-26 for llama.cpp on the same card. After the decode work
(2026-10-01 build): 48-72 tok/s on a ~190-token answer, prompt included (the first request after a start is the slower
one); 55-59 tok/s over 5,000-18,000-token answers on the 2026-09-30 build. The reserve matters:
with `--stream-experts` there is no host copy of the experts, so any expert left out of VRAM is read from the SSD
and computed on the CPU whenever it is routed. At 1,536 MiB the cache came up 128 experts short and decode fell to
5-10 tok/s; 1,024 MiB fits all 12,288 with 2 GB of VRAM still free.

**Logprobs (2026-10-02).** `/v1/chat/completions` takes OpenAI's `"logprobs": true` and `"top_logprobs": 0..20`,
streamed or not, through `sycl/serve/server_intel.py`; the reply carries `choices[0].logprobs.content[]` (`token`,
`logprob`, `bytes`, `top_logprobs`), and with thinking on the thinking tokens under `reasoning_content`. The engine
(the port only) gets `logprobs=K` on its GEN line and writes an `LP logprob id:logprob ...` line after each `T`
line, from the verify window's head logits - the distribution the token was taken from, before temperature,
penalties and sampling. Upstream's server ignores the lines, and an engine never asked writes none. Each token
costs one 1 MB logits row copy when asked. Measured (IQ2_XS, "capital of France"): "Paris" at -0.0019 (p 0.998), the
same answer and no measurable time without it. Not on `/v1/completions` or the Anthropic endpoint yet.

**The Monitor tab on Intel.** `sycl/serve/server_intel.py` is `serve/server.py` with two additions made at run
time:

- **GPU readings.** When NVML has no card, it plugs `sycl/serve/xe_telemetry.py` into `serve/telemetry.py`'s
  `gpu_reader`. That reads the Arc through sysfs (temperature, power and its cap, the PCIe link the card
  trained at). Load and VRAM come from `/run/gpustat.json`: xe reports them per client in `/proc/*/fdinfo`,
  which only root can read, so a small root sampler writes them (`sycl/tools/gpustat.py`; install it with its
  `gpustat.service` as its header says).
- **A Model menu.** A run config may name a `model_switcher` (an RPC taking `{"mode": m}`) for a host that swaps
  models on one card. The web app's header then gets a Model menu (`sycl/serve/web/switcher.js`, injected into
  the page).

**Speed depends on the text.** Decode with speculative decoding tracks how often the draft layer guesses right.
The served engine at 32K context: 45-51 tok/s on the test prompt (continuing a Fibonacci function, 77-85%
of drafts accepted), 30-39 tok/s on a chat answer with prose (55-72%); sampling and the repetition penalty cost
nothing measurable. The engine used to abort at exit in serve mode (a queue wait in a destructor after the
runtime's teardown began); it now exits directly once its requests are done.

**Planned (2026-09-30), in order.** Ranked by payoff on this card; the first three were taken first.

1. Expert dot products on XMX in integer mode: a decode window (up to 6 tokens) fits one INT8 DPAS (1-8 rows), the
   i-quant grids decode to small integers, the activations are already INT8. Today: scalar dp4a, ALU-bound (77%).
   **Parked**: three `joint_matrix` versions (opt-in `STRATA_EXPERT_XMX=1`, do not enable) were 1.4x and 2-3x slower
   than dp4a, and the third (B filled in place with `joint_matrix_apply`) hung the GPU. At 1-6 rows the grid decode
   and the packed-B layout cost more than the DPAS saves.
2. Experts missing from VRAM read from pinned host memory over PCIe instead of the SSD (the 256K decode collapse).
   **Done**: at start-up every expert without a VRAM slot is read into a pinned host mirror (`STRATA_MIRROR_MIB`, by
   default free RAM less 4 GiB), and the device-built verify plan points the expert kernels straight at it. Before,
   that plan dropped non-resident experts, so output with misses was wrong. Forced test (`--expert-cache 8000`,
   1,879 experts / 3.6 GiB out of VRAM): decode 2.6 -> 40.9 tok/s (full cache 43.3), prompt 451 -> 640 tok/s
   (776), output tokens identical to the full-cache run. About 3.6 GiB of VRAM can go to context for ~6% of decode.
3. KV streaming (`--kv-resident`) from 64K up: only the attended window of the KV in VRAM. **Done**: 256K decodes at
   31 tok/s (from 4-5).
4. QSA block selection on XMX: every query against every pooled block, a dense product that grows with the context.
5. The hot decode kernels re-tuned for Xe2's native 16-wide sub-groups (twice the registers per thread).
   **Tried, no gain**: SIMD16 builds of the multi-column mmvq and the wide Q6_K kernel (`STRATA_MMVQ_SG`: 16 all,
   1 IQ4_XS only, 2 short outputs only; default 32). Alone (`mmvq_sg_bench`) SIMD16 is up to 1.45x faster on IQ4_XS
   and 1.3x on the 640-row shared-expert projections, 10-25% slower on the large K-quant ones; in the engine no
   setting beats SIMD32 beyond run-to-run noise (SIMD32 itself lands at 39 or 45 tok/s). Output tokens identical.
   The same bench shows the real headroom: the dense decode kernels stream 100-280 GB/s of a 608 GB/s card
   (Q6_K, the most common type, ~146 GB/s at 2-4 columns).
   **Found and fixed: misaligned loads.** A Q6_K block is 210 bytes, so every block's `ql`/`qh` runs start only
   2-byte aligned, and the B70 splits a misaligned 16-byte load into pieces. The same weights repacked at a
   224-byte stride ran 2.3-4.7x faster (`q6k_align_bench`). Without changing the layout, the wide Q6_K kernel now
   does two aligned 16-byte loads and a shift (`load16_a2`; both stay inside the block) and takes every Q6_K
   shape and window width (it used to be gated to n_out >= 4096, 1-4 columns): 2560->10240 at 1/2/4/6 columns
   160/145/141/101 -> 493/432/331/273 GB/s, the 248K-row head 150 -> 407 GB/s at 1 column. Output tokens
   identical. **Coder decode 44.9 -> 54 tok/s** (2k prompt, greedy). `STRATA_MMVQ_A2=0` restores the old path.
   Still misaligned: IQ4_XS (136 B, 8-aligned, ~100 GB/s), IQ4_NL (18 B), Q8_0 (34 B); Q4_K/Q5_K are aligned
   but use 4-byte loads in the multi kernel (230-280 GB/s).

**Decode round 2 (2026-09-30), from a unitrace of 256 decoded tokens.** Each step measured on its own, 19-token prompt,
256 tokens, two runs each, output tokens identical throughout:

| | decode |
|---|---|
| after the Q6_K alignment fix | 53.9 tok/s |
| + `resident_plan` grouping in parallel (thread 0 alone took 73 us per layer, ~3.5 ms a round) | 57.1 |
| + the GR down kernel reads the activations directly (the 60 KB SLM tile per group capped occupancy) | 58.7 |
| + wide 16-byte-load kernels for Q4_K, Q5_K, IQ4_XS (codebook in registers) | 62.6 |
| + wide kernels for Q8_0 (MTP dense, shexp down of layer 0) and IQ4_NL (shexp down); Q6_K's activation loads aligned | 65.6 |
| + the GR down projection sliced by columns (each group stages one 128-column slice of xn, 4 lanes per row) + a fixed-order reduce | 70.6 |
| + IQ4_NL expert dots (the down projection in 39 of 48 layers): codebook in registers, weights as aligned 4-byte loads, bitwise the same ints (2026-10-01) | 76.1 |
| + GR norm per (token, stream), bitwise the same; aligned weight loads in the IQ3_XXS/IQ3_S/IQ2_S gate/up dots | **77.9** |

The last step changes the output: identical for 146 tokens, then a near-tie after a comma goes the other way (the new
kernels sum in a different order). Q8_0 kernels 4-6x (189 -> 31 us at 2560 x 10240, 2 columns), IQ4_NL 640 -> 2560
28 -> 6.6 us. The aligned-load helper only loads its second chunk when the address is unaligned, so it never reads a
16-byte chunk without a needed byte and cannot cross a page at the end of an allocation. `STRATA_MMVQ_WIDE_32=0`
restores the old Q8_0/IQ4_NL kernels. The sliced GR down kernel (GR read 108.6 -> 76.5 us at 6 tokens, sums equal to
~1e-7) flips that near-tie back: its output is the original one. `STRATA_GR_DOWN_SLICED=0` restores the direct kernel.

Kernel level: IQ4_XS 107 -> 323 GB/s at 2 columns (61 -> 212 at 6), Q4_K/Q5_K 1.3-1.6x; the GR read 135 -> 110 us at
6 tokens (bitwise equal). Switches to the old paths: `STRATA_PLAN_PARALLEL=0`, `STRATA_GR_DOWN_DIRECT=0`,
`STRATA_MMVQ_WIDE_K=0`. (`iq_parity` reports 10 "missing fixture" failures with and without the change: the oracle
fixtures are not in the port's tree.)

**Two-speed runs, explained (2026-09-30).** Identical greedy runs decode at either ~45 or ~39 tok/s. A per-gather
trace of the PLE reader (`STRATA_PLE_TRACE=1`) shows the slow runs pay one 226 ms PLE read stall in the first
decode round, after the window graphs are captured; every other read and round matches the fast runs. Prompt time
plus decode time is the same in both modes (4.95-5.17 s): the stall lands either in the prompt's PLE wait or in the
first decode round, so it is a once-per-process cost, not lost throughput. Ruled out: NVMe APST, the I/O scheduler
(`none`), CPU starvation (93% idle during decode), I/O thread count. Compare runs on time to first token + decode.
6. INT8 prompt GEMMs: experts dequantized to INT8, oneMKL/oneDNN INT8 on XMX (half the dequant bytes, 2x rate).
7. Fewer graph nodes per decode round (~2,500 at ~5 us): norm+rope, scores+top-k, gate+quantize fused.
8. Wider speculation (two draft branches per verify window): the kernels are latency-bound, so it is nearly free.
9. A model bigger than VRAM: the original Qwen3.8-Flash-Next IQ2_XS (35.5 GB of experts; the same path suits Q2_0
   and Swift 1.5) on the B70 with 23 GB of RAM. ~24 GB of experts in VRAM, the rest (~10-12 GB) in the pinned host
   mirror the device plan reads over PCIe (item 2). The port has the IQ2_XS/IQ3_XXS/Q2_0 expert kernels. Open: whether
   a 10+ GB pinned mirror fits beside everything else in 23 GB, and decode with that share of experts on a Gen3 x8
   link (3.6 GB mirrored measured 40.9 tok/s; expect less). Needs the 68 GB download.
   **Done (2026-10-01)**: shard 1 downloaded (39.2 GB; shard 2 is byte-identical to the Coder's, so a hard link),
   a native pack (`tools/iq_pack.py`, 6 s), the original model's expert profile, the same MTP draft layer. 18,329 of
   24,576 experts in VRAM (24.6 GiB), 6,247 in the pinned host mirror (8.4 GiB, 9 s to fill), host RAM never below
   12 GB free. **Decode 50.8 tok/s** on the 19-token prompt and **60.6** after 2,184 tokens, prompt 549 tok/s;
   coherent, correct answers on both. Q2_0 and Swift 1.5 (similar size) should behave the same; IQ3_XXS/IQ3_S
   (43-50 GB of experts) would need 19-26 GB mirrored, more than 23 GB of RAM allows.

**Keeping up with upstream.** A merge of upstream `main` into `b70` leaves the copies in `sycl/` behind
wherever upstream touched a file they mirror. They are refreshed by re-migration, not by hand (done for
0.1.25-0.1.27, 2026-09-30):

1. Merge upstream into `b70`. No shared file should conflict: the Intel code is all in `sycl/`. Then check that
   `sycl/setup_intel.py --check` and `sycl/serve/server_intel.py --engine mock` still run against the new
   setup.py and server.py.
2. Migrate the *old* upstream tree (a `git archive` of the pre-merge commit) with `migrate.sh` into
   `sycl-base`, and the merged tree into `sycl-new`; about 3 minutes each in the dev image.
3. `sycl/tools/normalize.sh <dir> <commit>` on both: dpct's file names, the unchanged files, the
   message serials, then `fixups.py`. Two runs of dpct on the same source now differ only in the kernel
   name hashes it generates.
4. For every file present in both: `git merge-file sycl/F sycl-base/F sycl-new/F`. Files upstream did not
   change are left alone. Copies dpct never produced (`verify.cpp`, `mtp.cpp`, `remote_experts.cpp`
   include no CUDA header directly) take upstream's diff by hand; new parity tests are copied in and
   listed in `sycl/CMakeLists.txt`.
5. A fixup whose pattern upstream changed shows up as a compile error (the PTX gate became an `#elif`
   under upstream's `__HIPCC__` guard); extend the fixup, re-run it, rebuild.

**The 0.1.31 merge (2026-10-01).** Upstream 0.1.29 -> 0.1.31 (132 commits) by the steps above: 45 migrated files
changed for real (27 more only in dpct's kernel-name hashes), 38 conflicts resolved, verify.cpp/mtp.cpp/
conversation_state.cpp ported by hand. A symbol audit (the port's feature identifiers counted before and after) is
part of the procedure now: it caught a dropped mirror hook and four doorbell waits that had lost their spin bound
(upstream renamed the loops; `fixups.py` covers both spellings). What the merge needed beyond conflicts:

- **The expert kernels.** Upstream sends the i-quant experts to new multi kernels (one warp per row, 8 rows a
  group); the port's grid is sized for its own kernels (8 lanes a row, 32 rows a group), so only a quarter of each
  expert's rows were written and the output was end-of-text tokens. The port's kernels stay the default (they also
  serve upstream's new Q4_K/Q5_K/Q5_1/Q8_0 experts); `STRATA_EXPERT_SPLIT=1` runs upstream's, with their grid.
- **Prompt-slot borrowing hung** in the first chunk of any prompt with it on (40K, 128K; GPU busy) - fixed after
  the 0.1.32 merge, see "Prompt-slot borrowing: the hang" below.
- **Upstream's new tests found three dpct mistranslations from the first migration.** dpct writes `__fadd_rn(a, b)`
  as `a + b` without parentheses, so `__fadd_rn(sum, c ? x : y)` became `sum + c ? x : y` (replaced, not added): in
  the native QSA indexer's per-token pooled key (the decode path: blocks completed while generating got wrong
  pooled keys; prompt blocks come from the batched kernel and were right), in the native QSA scores (an opt-in
  path) and in the s2 activation rounding (every value 0; the Q2_0 s2 pack, unused here). Fixed, and `fixups.py`
  now parenthesises. `qsa_parity`'s batch-vs-sequential test passes; decode output after long prompts changed.
- **Upstream's new kernels against the port's on the B70** (decode tok/s, Coder 19 / 2,184-token prompts, IQ2_XS
  19): port defaults 78.1 / 75.7 / 58.6; `STRATA_EXPERT_SPLIT=1` 65.6-69.5 / 67.2 / 49.1 (-11 to -16%);
  `STRATA_GR_V3=1` 73.2 / 72.4 (-4 to -6%). Both stay opt-in.
- **Lanes per row of the port's expert kernels** (`STRATA_GU_LANES` / `STRATA_DOWN_LANES`, 4/8/16/32 at run time):
  gate/up 8 or 16 x down 4 or 8 all decode in 37.7-38.6 ms per verify round (2 runs each, Coder, both prompts); tok/s
  differences between them are draft acceptance (each split rounds differently). The default (8 / 8) stays.
- **Speed after the merge:** Coder 78.2 / 75.7 tok/s (as before), IQ2_XS 58.6 / 64.2 (from 50.8 / 60.6).
- **Still failing:** (`iq_multi_parity` on IQ2_XS: fixed later, see "Two model-specific bugs"), `s2_expert_grouped_parity` (the s2 path), `kv_hybrid_parity`'s last step
  (needs the unported tensor-core prompt kernel). `ple_parity` and `native_expert_parity` need model files.

**The 0.1.32 merge (2026-10-01).** Upstream 0.1.31 -> 0.1.32 (89 commits) by the same steps; the hash-only
differences are now canonicalized before `git merge-file` (the port's kernel-name hashes are kept), which left 10
files with real conflicts. What it needed:

- **Upstream's async commit** (`set_commit_async` / `wait_commit`) maps onto the port's own deferred commit
  (`commit(n, err, false)` + `commit_finish`); `wait_commit` is `commit_finish`.
- **Upstream's new hyper-connection read variants** (split / staged, chosen per card by a bit-for-bit self-test at
  start) are not used by the port, which keeps its sliced down / split norm read; the self-test segfaulted on the
  B70, so on SYCL it runs only with `STRATA_HC_CHECK=1` (open). The port's split-norm kernel was renamed
  (`gr_norm_split_port_kernel`): upstream now has one of the same name.
- Two kernel names collided after hash canonicalization (renamed), and fused_gr's per-block shared-memory query is
  a fixup now.
- **Result:** every output identical to 0.1.31 (Coder 19 / 2,184-token prompts and IQ2_XS, 256 greedy tokens),
  same speeds (Coder 77.7-78.1 / 75.7 tok/s, IQ2_XS 58.5), 40K prompt 1,201 tok/s then 65.1 tok/s decode.
  `kv_hybrid_parity` and `qsa_prompt_attn_parity` pass (the tests now turn on the XMX prompt attention they
  check); `iq_multi_parity` (IQ2_XS) and `s2_expert_grouped_parity` as before.

**The 0.1.33 merge (2026-10-01).** Upstream 0.1.32 -> 0.1.33 (17 commits): no shared file conflicted (the Intel
code is all in `sycl/`); six engine files changed upstream and were merged by the same re-migration (only those six:
the other files dpct produced differently were left alone). Two conflicts: `--resident-cpu-experts` (upstream's new
`resident_cpu_explicit` beside the port's `--stream-experts`) and the prompt attention's compute-capability check
(the port keeps its XMX dispatch). `sycl/setup_intel.py` and `sycl/serve/server_intel.py` ran unchanged against the
new setup.py and server.py. Every output identical (Coder, IQ2_XS, the 40K prompt with borrowing); `gr_parity` and
`qsa_prompt_attn_parity` pass.

**Prompt-slot borrowing: the hang (fixed 2026-10-01).** From 0.1.31 on, a prompt that borrowed cache slots stopped
in its first full chunk with the GPU at 100% and the host waiting on the compute queue. It was never a borrowing
bug: borrowing is just the only way the Coder streams experts during a prompt (every expert is resident otherwise),
and the streamed path's stager deadlocked. Its threads read experts into a ring of 16 page-locked buffers and, to
reuse one, waited on the copy queue's event for the DMA that last read it (the CUDA form, `cudaEventSynchronize`).
Under the Level Zero v2 adapter that event, once a host thread had waited on it, no longer released the other
queue's barrier that also listed it, and the GPU waited forever - only once a layer streamed more than 16 experts
(the ring wrapped). The v1 adapter (`SYCL_UR_USE_LEVEL_ZERO_V2=0`) and a 256-buffer ring both ran; so did a sync
after every phase (`STRATA_PREFILL_SYNC=1`, kept as a debug switch). The fix: the copy queue writes a sequence
number into page-locked host memory after each DMA and the stager polls it - no host thread waits on a queue's
event. Output is bit-identical to the run without borrowing; borrowing is the default above 32K again.

**Two model-specific bugs found with Swift 1.5 (fixed 2026-10-01).** UkisAI's Swift 1.5 IQ2_XS (setup's `swift`
family, the same GSQ-RCO layout) decoded token 0 forever: NaN logits from layer 13 on.

- **`--stream-experts` read the wrong shard.** Since upstream 0.1.31, `ExpertLayout::gguf_file` is per layer AND role
  (`3 * layer + role`; a shard boundary can fall inside a layer). The port's `GgufExpertSource` still indexed it by
  layer, so a layer in shard 2 was read from shard 1 at shard 2's offsets: garbage IQ1_M scales, infinities after the
  fp16 dequantization. The original model keeps every expert in shard 1 and never noticed; Swift's layers 13-47 are
  in shard 2. `STRATA_DBG_NAN=1` now also reports the experts' fp16 GEMM inputs (activations, dequantized gate/up).
- **IQ2_XS products were garbage** (the long-failing `iq_multi_parity` IQ2_XS case): ggml's `vec_dot_iq2_xs` reads
  its four 16-bit codes through a `uint16_t*` to an `int2`, type punning the SYCL device compiler does not honour;
  the dequantizer, which reads the codes directly, was exact. The codes are extracted by shifts now (the dot and the
  expert kernels' `Split<17>`); the test checks against a CPU decode from ggml's tables too and passes. No model here
  uses IQ2_XS tensors, Swift included - this was not Swift's bug, only found on the way.

Swift 1.5 IQ2_XS after both: correct answers, 51-118 words of thinking on short questions, 48 tok/s raw decode.

**Load time (2026-10-02).** Starting a model is mostly the expert cache's fill from the GGUF (`--stream-experts`):
the Coder's 23.4 GiB of experts took 64-76 s, the IQ2_XS's 24.9 GiB 91 s, because the fill read each expert's
three slices, copied the blob and waited for the copy before the next read. It is a pipeline now: the slots are
admitted in profile order first (the same placement), the reads go in file order by up to 8 threads into
page-locked batches of 64, and a batch's copies run while the next one is read. Cold page cache: 76.2 s -> 18.8 s
(0.33 -> 1.34 GB/s); a whole Coder start from the engine's launch to its first token 82 s -> 26 s, the IQ2_XS
120 s -> 41 s (its 8.2 GB host mirror is ~9 s of the rest). Output identical. `STRATA_FILL_SERIAL=1` is the old fill.

**The stream-all prompt walk is back (2026-10-03).** It copies every expert the VRAM cache does not hold, layer by
layer ahead of the compute, instead of only the routed ones. It hung on the B70 until the stager and PLE fixes of
2026-10-02 and runs since. It now runs by default when the VRAM holds more than 90% of the (layer, expert) pairs;
past that it would copy several times the routed experts (the IQ2_XS keeps a quarter of them in the RAM mirror: a
2,184-token prompt fell from ~560 to 254 tok/s with it). `STRATA_PREFILL_STREAM_ALL=1` / `=0` force it on or off.
Coder, outputs identical either way:

| prompt | routed-only | stream-all |
|---|---|---|
| 40K int8 | 1,106 tok/s | 1,160 |
| 128K int8, KV streaming | 897 | 920 |
| 128K k8v4 | 1,006 | 1,041 |
| 256K int8, KV streaming | 760 | 780 |

Measured alongside: the 2,184-token prompt reads 784-799 tok/s on both the 0.1.35+PR and the 0.1.38 build (three
runs each), so the 825 seen once on 0.1.35 was session variance, not a regression. The prompt path at 40K (Coder,
GPU timeline): expert dequant 15.7%, expert GEMMs 23.4%, host grouping 6.5%, gather 5.7%, combine 2.4%, prompt
attention 19.2%, QSA select 6.8%, DeltaNet recurrence 5.8%, hyper-connection reads 4.6%. Upstream's sm_90 cluster
kernels (greedy sampler, QSA top-k) would save next to nothing here: the sampler reads ~6 MB a round against a 13 ms
token. Q4_0 tensor-core prompt attention (#452) is not worth porting: the port's XMX prompt attention is 2-3x slower
than the plain kernel it uses for every KV format.

**The 0.1.38 merge (2026-10-03).** Upstream 0.1.35 -> 0.1.38 (83 commits) merged the seven PRs the port had taken
early, so their header forks in `sycl/include` are gone; the merge base for the 3-way merge was the port's own "main +
PRs" migration. New in the port with it: the DeltaNet output norm without its dead FP32 store, two prompt-path
fixes (the fused layout's buffers, the streamed walk's resident lookup), `STRATA_GR_DOWN_MAX4=1` (opt-in; neutral on
the B70: 2,184-token prompt 793 vs 788 tok/s, decode 76.2 vs 76.3). Stubbed in the port: `--peer-device` (a second
GPU as an expert-cache tier: upstream's code is CUDA calls; `open` refuses with a message) and the fused int8 prompt
kernels (#136, part of the MMQ library the port does not build). Off on SYCL: the sm_90 thread-block-cluster greedy
sampler and QSA top-k (no SYCL counterpart; the callers take the plain kernels). `STRATA_GDN_KEYHEAD=1` stays opt-in
(still 8% slower here: 727 vs 788 tok/s). `qsa_prompt_attn_parity` now also tests upstream's Q4_0 tensor-core mode
(#452), which the port does not have: those cases report "refused" (the int8 and fp16 XMX cases pass); a `--kv
q4_0` prompt takes the older kernel, as before. Outputs identical (Coder, IQ2_XS, 40K); 128K int8 KV streaming
892 / 66.8 tok/s.

**0.1.35 and seven open upstream PRs (2026-10-02).** Upstream main 0.1.33 -> 0.1.35 merged as before, then seven open
PRs ported into `sycl/` ahead of upstream (one dpct run of main + all of them, 3-way merged into only the files they
touch; `sycl/tools/merge_upstream.py`). Their header changes live in `sycl/include` until upstream merges them.

| PR | what | on the B70 |
|---|---|---|
| #385 (sergqwer) | stager: a buffer's first job of a generation waits for the previous DMA from it | race fix; same output |
| #463 (constantindjonkam) | decode waits for an adaptive swap before reading the residency table | determinism fix |
| #453 (architectds) | the drafter's batched K/V on the KV-streaming ring | 128K int8: 888 -> 895 tok/s prompt, 66.6 -> 67.0 decode |
| #374 (sergqwer) | the first chunk's PLE rows read beside layer 0 | part of the 2,184-token prompt's 784 -> 825 tok/s |
| #363 (BlueKingMuch) | the PCIe expert call: group stride, fused SwiGLU + q8_1 | IQ2_XS decode +1.7%; re-done on the port's lane kernels |
| #407 (sergqwer) | `--adapt-tuned` (opt-in) | neutral here; stays opt-in |
| #413 (BlueKingMuch) | DeltaNet recurrence per key head | bit-identical but 8% slower prompt here: off (`STRATA_GDN_KEYHEAD=1`) |

#374 needed two port fixes: its next-chunk read assumed every chunk is the full chunk length (the port's first chunk
is 256 tokens: the second chunk's rows were read from the wrong place), and its host wait on the PLE upload's event,
now inside the layer loop, deadlocked the prompt past ~4K tokens under the Level Zero v2 adapter (the stager's bug
again): the upload is marked by a polled sequence number now. #413's gate is an NVIDIA SM-count rule and its parity
test an SM-holding NVIDIA bench (not built). Outputs identical to 0.1.33 (Coder 19 / 2,184 tokens, IQ2_XS, 40K).

**Not ported yet (2026-10-01).**

- Three kernels carry inline PTX (`mma.sync` tensor-core matrix ops, `ldmatrix`, `cp.async`):
  `qsa_prompt_attn`, `qsa_select`'s block scores, `native_qsa_score`. The SYCL build takes the "older card"
  fallback the CUDA build uses below sm_80. `qsa_prompt_attn` also has an XMX version (`joint_matrix`, opt-in
  `STRATA_PROMPT_ATTN_XMX=1`): correct, but slower than the fallback (see "XMX prompt attention v2").
- The ggml MMQ prefill path (`moe_mmq.cu`) needs llama.cpp's ggml-cuda sources; not built.
- AOT device code is what runs: `AOT=bmg-g31 BUILD_DIR=.../build-sycl-aot` (the JIT build costs ~47 s of
  compiling on the first window).

## Not done

- Images, on both Intel engines. Strata's vision path encodes with `strata-vision` into embeddings the CUDA
  engine reads; neither the SYCL port nor the llama.cpp config wires it yet.
- Speculative decoding on the llama.cpp path (the GGUF carries no draft layer llama.cpp can use). The SYCL
  port has it (MTP draft layer, `--mtp`).
