# Intel Arc (experimental)

Strata 0.1.39 includes an **experimental Intel Arc engine**: Strata's own engine ported to SYCL (Intel oneAPI).
maxfridbe wrote it in [#423](https://github.com/Niko1221/Strata/pull/423), with fixes from the people testing it.
The code is in `sycl/`, and the port's own notes, measurements and maintenance procedure are in
[docs/INTEL.md](INTEL.md). This page covers what you need, how to build it, and what has been tested.

**Experimental means:** the Strata maintainers have no Intel GPU. We compile the port and run its kernel tests, but
we have not run it on an Arc. Every result on Arc hardware below comes from the community. The NVIDIA and AMD
engines are unchanged: the Intel build is a separate CMake target, off by default.

There is **no ready-made Intel engine** in the release zips. You build it from source on Linux.

## What has been run, and by whom

| | Hardware | Result | Reported in |
|---|---|---|---|
| Port author | Arc Pro B70 32 GB, Ubuntu 24.04 | Coder IQ1_M: 70-78 tok/s decode, ~790 tok/s prompt; IQ2_XS: 51-64 tok/s; 256K context measured | #423, [INTEL.md](INTEL.md) |
| Community | 2x Arc Pro B70, `--layer-split` | Flash-Next IQ3_XXS 66 tok/s decode, 394 tok/s prompt (with the `stage_room` fix that is now in 0.1.39) | #423 |
| Community | Arc Pro B50 16 GB | Coder IQ1_M ~23 tok/s, IQ2_XS ~25-27 tok/s, up to 128K | #423 |
| Community | Arc B580 12 GB, WSL2 | IQ2_XS ~21 tok/s, Coder ~15 tok/s; **device loss also seen** | #423 |
| Strata maintainers | no Arc | compile check and kernel tests on a CPU device only (below) | this release |

The 0.1.39 port re-migrates 0.1.38's port onto the 0.1.39 engine sources (the #606 NaN fix, the #649 verify
trace, the new prompt paths). It compiles and its kernel tests run, but **nobody has run the 0.1.39 port on an Arc
yet**. The numbers in the table were measured on earlier versions.

## What was tested here (0.1.39)

- **Compiles:** Ubuntu 24.04 (WSL2), Intel oneAPI DPC++ 2026.1.1 + oneMKL 2026.1. The whole `sycl/` project
  builds with 0 errors: the `strata` engine plus all 157 targets (the kernel parity tests and benches). The build is
  SPIR-V (JIT). The AOT build (`STRATA_SYCL_AOT`) was not built here, because it needs `ocloc`.
- **Kernel parity tests on a CPU** (`ONEAPI_DEVICE_SELECTOR=opencl:cpu`, Intel's OpenCL CPU runtime, AMD Ryzen 5 7600):
  14 of 25 pass. That is the same set that PR #423's own 0.1.38 port passes on that device: the failures are tight
  float tolerances on the CPU's math (rel 3e-6 against a 1e-6 limit), model fixtures that are not present, and two
  tests that time out on a CPU. This is a check that the kernels compile and compute, not a test of an Arc.
- **Setup:** `--backend sycl` warns, then hands over to `sycl/setup_intel.py` on Linux (unit tests:
  `tools/test_setup_sycl.py`).
- **Unchanged:** the CUDA engine's greedy output, checked byte-identical against the gated 0.1.39 build (Q2_0 and Coder).
  The HIP build is not affected (the option is off by default).

**Not tested by anyone yet:** Windows (no native build path; see below), Arc on WSL2 for the 0.1.39 port, the Alchemist
A-series, integrated Arc GPUs (the B390 / Panther Lake in #515; the shared-memory planning does not exist yet), and
images (not wired on Intel).

## What you need

- **Linux**, e.g. Ubuntu 24.04, with Intel's GPU driver (the `xe` or `i915` kernel driver plus the compute runtime /
  Level Zero; on Ubuntu, `intel-opencl-icd libze1 libze-intel-gpu1`, or Intel's
  [client GPU guide](https://dgpu-docs.intel.com/driver/client/overview.html)).
- **Intel oneAPI**: the DPC++ compiler (`icpx`, 2025.3 or newer; 2026.1 is what was built here) and **oneMKL**. About 5 GB.
- `cmake` 3.24+, `ninja`, `git` (the build fetches ggml unless you point `STRATA_GGML_DIR` at a llama.cpp checkout),
  Python 3.
- For `setup --backend sycl` today: **Docker**. `sycl/setup_intel.py` runs the engine in the `strata-sycl-dev`
  image built from `sycl/tools/Dockerfile`. Note that the Dockerfile starts from a community llama.cpp SYCL image
  (`ghcr.io/snailium/...`), not an Intel or Strata image.
- VRAM: the port keeps the experts on the card (`--stream-experts`). A 32 GB card holds the Coder IQ1_M or IQ2_XS.
  Smaller cards mirror part of the experts in RAM and are slower.

## Build (Linux)

Install oneAPI from Intel's apt repository (this is what was used here):

```sh
wget -qO- https://apt.repos.intel.com/intel-gpg-keys/GPG-PUB-KEY-INTEL-SW-PRODUCTS.PUB \
  | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/oneapi-archive-keyring.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/oneapi-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.repos.intel.com/oneapi all main" \
  | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/oneAPI.list
sudo apt update
sudo apt install intel-oneapi-compiler-dpcpp-cpp intel-oneapi-mkl-devel ninja-build cmake git
```

Then build the engine. Either command works: the first goes through the top-level CMake option, the second
configures the `sycl/` project directly.

```sh
source /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh
cmake -S . -B build-sycl -G Ninja -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=icx -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=icpx -DSTRATA_ENABLE_SYCL=ON
#   or: cmake -S sycl -B build-sycl -G Ninja -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=icx -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=icpx
cmake --build build-sycl --target strata
```

Options:

- `-DSTRATA_SYCL_AOT=bmg-g31` (Arc Pro B70) or `bmg-g21` (B580 / B570 / Pro B60) compiles the GPU code ahead of
  time. This needs `ocloc` (Intel's `intel-ocloc` package). Without it, the first start JIT-compiles every kernel,
  which takes about 47 s.
- `-DSTRATA_SYCL_PARITY=OFF` skips the kernel tests (on by default). Run them with
  `ctest --test-dir build-sycl` on the card.

`setup_intel.py` looks for `build-sycl-aot/strata` or `build-sycl/strata` in the checkout. With the
top-level option the engine is at `build-sycl/sycl/strata`, so either use `-S sycl` or set `STRATA_SYCL_BIN`.

## Setup and running

```sh
./setup.sh --backend sycl [setup's usual options, e.g. --model IQ2_XS --context 32768]
```

This prints the experimental warning and continues with `sycl/setup_intel.py`. That script finds the Arc in sysfs,
uses the SYCL engine you built, and writes the config and `run-<model>.sh`. It still downloads and packs the model
the usual way. To run the engine by hand (no Docker), see "How to run it by hand" in [INTEL.md](INTEL.md).

Things that matter on an Arc (details in INTEL.md):

- **Do not ask for more VRAM than the card has.** On the `xe` driver, an allocation past VRAM can push buffers into
  RAM until the machine runs out of memory and stalls. Leave about 1.5 GB free.
- `SYCL_CACHE_PERSISTENT=0`: the persistent JIT cache crashed on Xe2 during the first compile.
- Two cards: `ONEAPI_DEVICE_SELECTOR=level_zero:*` (the image pins `level_zero:0`; `strata-sycl.sh` now passes the
  variable through) and `--layer-split`.
- `STRATA_VERIFY_NO_HOST=1` (set by `strata-sycl.sh`) is only valid when every expert is in VRAM. On smaller cards
  that path is the one that has hung, and #667 found the likely reason: the GPU does not see the CPU's flag
  stores without a system fence.

## Windows

There is no Windows path yet. `setup --backend sycl` on Windows stops and points here. oneAPI exists for Windows,
but `sycl/CMakeLists.txt` uses GCC-style flags (`-mavx512f`, `-fp-model=precise`, `-qmkl`) and the runner is a
bash/Docker script, so a native Windows build would need work. Nobody has tried it. WSL2 with an Arc has been
used by one tester (the B580 row above), but setup cannot detect the card there, because it reads `/sys/class/drm`,
which WSL2 does not have.

## Reporting a problem

Open an issue with: the card, the driver version, `sycl-ls` output, the oneAPI version, the model and flags, and the
engine's stderr. Results from real cards are what move this from experimental to supported.
