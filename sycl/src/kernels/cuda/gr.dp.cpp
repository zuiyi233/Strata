// src/kernels/cuda/gr.cu - P2.S2: the gated residual / hyper-connection, `gr_read` and `gr_write`.
//
// See include/strata/kernels/gr.hpp for the semantics, for why the weights are bf16, and for the history of
// this kernel's 134x-off-the-floor first version.  The short form: it was launched `<<<1, 256>>>` so that
// `xn`/`xq` fit in shared memory, which used ONE of 48 SMs and cost 262 ms/token.
//
// THE SHAPE OF THE FIX is that each projection is an ordinary GEMV and is now mapped the way the shapes want:
//
//     norm    hc blocks, one per residual stream            (each needs its own reduction)
//     down    ONE WARP PER OUTPUT ROW, lanes stride the 10240 reduction axis
//     gate    ONE WARP PER OUTPUT ROW, lanes stride the 320 reduction axis
//     mean    a flat elementwise pass over n_embd
//
// WARP-PER-ROW RATHER THAN THREAD-PER-ROW, and that is the whole difference.  A thread walking one row is
// coalesced with ITSELF and 32 transactions away from its warp neighbours: `w_down[k*hc_dim + i]` for fixed k
// is contiguous, but two threads on rows k and k+1 are hc_dim*2 bytes apart.  With the warp on one row, lanes
// i, i+1, i+2 touch consecutive addresses in EITHER orientation - which is why this version needs no
// transposed copies and takes both matrices exactly as the manifest stores them.
//
// Layouts are the MANIFEST's: `hc_attn_down.weight` is [10240, 320] with ne0 = hc*n_embd fast, so it holds
// `w_down[k][i]` with i contiguous - `ref/gr.py`'s (hc_lr, hc*n_embd) row-major.  `hc_attn_up.weight` is
// [320, 10240] so it holds `w_up[i][k]` with k contiguous - `ref/gr.py`'s (hc*n_embd, hc_lr) row-major.  Both
// index with no permutation at all.

    // either way.  Removed, on the rule this file already states about `#pragma unroll 4`: a hint that does not
    // change the timing is a claim that is not true.
    //
    // The reason is that `gr_read`'s cost is not here.  Its four kernels are the norm (4 blocks), this (40),
    // `gr_gate_kernel` (1,280) and the mean (10), and the 1,280-block gate kernel reads 6.55 MB of weights with
    // good occupancy - so `gr_read`'s ~93 us is mostly the gate kernel at its own memory rate, and the ~165 GB/s
    // whole-call figure is an average over kernels that do not share a rate.
    // **FP32, AND THE FP64 THAT WAS HERE COST MORE THAN EVERYTHING ELSE IN `gr_read`.**
    //
    // This accumulated in `double`.  GeForce Blackwell executes FP64 at a small fraction of FP32 - 1/64 on
    // recent parts - so a 320-step dependent FP64 chain per lane turned a memory-bound reduction into a
    // latency-bound one.  The `nsys` per-kernel table (round 2) measured it at **5.07 ms/token, 15.3% of all
    // GPU time**, against `gr_gate_kernel`'s 1.23 ms - which REFUTES the comment that used to sit here, that
    // "gr_read's ~93 us is mostly the gate kernel at its own memory rate".  It was not: down + inject were
    // 8.77 of gr_read's 10.8 ms, and the gate was 1.23.
    //
    // The justification for `double` was matching `ref/gr.py`'s float64 transcription.  **The ground truth is
    // llama.cpp, and llama.cpp accumulates in FP32** - so this does not move away from the oracle, it moves
    // toward it, and the review's G1 lists it first.
    //
    // Four independent accumulators were tried here BEFORE, against the FP64 version, and measured no change
    // (39.86 vs 39.80 ms/token) - because FP64 throughput was the limit, not the dependency chain.  With FP32
    // the kernel becomes memory-bound: it reads ~13 MB per call across xq and w_down, which at the measured
    // 641 GB/s is ~20 us against the 52 us this took.
    // **THE OCCUPANCY CONCLUSION ABOVE IS STALE, AND THIS IS THE RETEST IT ASKED FOR.**
    //
    // "Fixing it does not pay" was measured against the FP64 version, where FP64 THROUGHPUT was the limit and
    // more parallelism could not help.  The kernel is FP32 now (round 282: 5.07 -> 2.38 ms/token) and the limit
