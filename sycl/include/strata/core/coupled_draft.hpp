// include/strata/core/coupled_draft.hpp - COUPLED DRAFT SAMPLING (STRATA_SPEC_COUPLED=1, off by default).
//
// Under sampling the verify window samples row t of a window at position pos0 as Philox(seed, pos0 + t) over the
// sampler chain (penalties -> top_k -> top_p -> min_p -> temperature -> inverse-CDF pick; verify.cpp run(),
// sampler.cu), and a draft is kept only when it EQUALS that row's pick.  The output is therefore a function of the
// seed alone, whatever the drafts are: drafts only decide how many tokens a window yields.
//
// The MTP draft layer used to propose its ARGMAX.  In coupled mode it SAMPLES instead, with the target's own chain
// (the request's top_k / top_p / min_p / temperature and penalties over the same history) and the SAME uniform the
// target will draw for the row that verifies the draft.  When the draft's distribution is close to the target's,
// the two inverse-CDF picks from one uniform agree far more often than an argmax agrees with a sample; the target's
// pick - and so the text - does not change, because verification is still exact-match against the target's sample.
//
// THE COUNTER ARITHMETIC (all positions are sequence indices; a window's row t holds the token at pos0 + t and its
// pick is the token at pos0 + t + 1, drawn with counter pos0 + t):
//   * MTP cell c pairs the main model's residual at position c with the token at c + 1 and predicts the token at
//     c + 2 (mtp.hpp).
//   * After a window at p with a drafts accepted, the next window starts at p' = p + a + 1 (its row 0 is the token
//     the window picked at row a).  Chain step j (j = 0 ..) runs at cell p + a + j and predicts the token at
//     p + a + j + 2 = p' + j + 1: row j + 1 of the next window, VERIFIED BY ROW j's pick, counter p' + j.
//   * So a draft made at cell c is verified with counter c + 1 - whatever the window size T, the accepted count, a
//     suffix-drafter window in between (its drafts are then simply not used), or `draft_first` (cell p - 1, a = 0 for
//     a window at p).  The kernel reads c from the step record the host already stages for the cell (device memory,
//     so the captured graphs replay with each round's own counter), and the seed and chain from a device copy of the
//     request's SamplerParams, refreshed at the start of every round graph.
//
// THE PENALTY HISTORY.  The verify row j of the next window counts penalties over penalty_rows(consumed', window')
// row j: the last h of (consumed', x', drafts 0 .. j-1), where consumed' is what the session holds after the commit
// and x' the window's pick at row a.  The drafter keeps a device RING of kCoupledHistCap + max_t slots: the host
// stages the base (the last h of consumed' + x', -1 padded in front) in [cap - h, cap) before the round, and draft j
// writes its token to cap + j - so draft j's window is [cap + j - h, cap + j), exactly the row the target will use.
