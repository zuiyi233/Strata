// include/strata/core/peer_experts.hpp - multi-GPU: a second expert tier on another GPU.
//
// The primary GPU (device 0) keeps everything it had: the dense weights, the KV cache, the MTP layer, its own
// adaptive expert tier and the captured verify graph.  This class adds an expert tier on a SECOND card.  From
// the verify graph's point of view nothing changes: for each layer the pool thread decides which routed experts
// the primary computes (its VRAM tier, the PCIe share), and every remaining expert is a "CPU row" the graph reads
// from mapped host memory after the pool raises its flag.  The peer takes the rows whose experts it holds: the
// pool thread launches them on the peer right after publishing the primary's plan, the CPU computes the rest at
// the same time, and the peer's rows are written into the same mapped rows before the pool returns.
//
// The peer computes with the SAME kernels as the primary's hit path (q8_1 activations + native_expert_grouped),
// from the same activation values, so an expert gives bit-identical rows on either card.
//
// The tier follows the conversation like the primary's: `adapt` swaps the most-routed experts that neither card
// holds into the peer's least-used slots (per layer, so a slot keeps its layer's blob size).
