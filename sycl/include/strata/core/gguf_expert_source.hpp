// include/strata/core/gguf_expert_source.hpp - the SYCL port: experts read from the GGUF on demand, no host arena.
//
// **WHY.** `ArenaExpertSource` keeps every expert as a resident host copy (R2.1): 23.4 GiB for the Coder, which
// the CPU pool computes misses from. On a card that holds every expert (12,288 slots on a 32 GB Arc) nothing is
// ever computed from that copy after the fill, and on a 23 GiB machine the copy cannot exist at all. This source
// gathers one blob at a time straight from the model's shard - the same three tensor slices the arena loader
// concatenates - into a small ring of staging buffers. The pointer is valid until the ring wraps, which is the
// `ExpertSource` contract ("until the next `blob()` call") with slack.
//
// It is slow per blob (three reads, ~2.7 MB) and that is fine: the profile fill reads each expert once at start,
// the prefill's lent slots are refilled a few hundred at a time, and with every expert resident the pool never
// asks. `pinned()` is false and `device_alias()` null, so nothing tries to DMA from it.
