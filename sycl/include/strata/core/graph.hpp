// include/strata/core/graph.hpp - P2.S5: the GraphRegistry.
//
// `GraphRegistry`: capture/replay wrappers keyed by `(layer_type, n_tokens)`, with static input/output
// buffers at fixed addresses.
//
// THREE THINGS ARE BAKED INTO THIS INTERFACE, and each one is a measurement rather than a preference.  All
// three come from `bench/micro/graph_capture.cu`, which was written to answer the phase's own instruction -
// "verify on the installed CUDA version with a minimal test before building on it".
//
// 1. **THE WAIT MUST POLL THE DRIVER, NOT MEMORY.**  The phase's host loop says "spin on
//    doorbell_seq == expected ... no cudaStreamSynchronize anywhere".  A spin that only reads memory NEVER
//    RUNS THE KERNEL: 5,907,703 spins over 500 ms, and the datum flips to 1 the instant anything calls into
//    the driver and never before.  On Windows the display driver model BATCHES command submission, and a
//    thread that only reads memory gives it no reason to flush.  Hence `wait_ms`, which polls an event -
//    a QUERY and not a blocking sync, so P2.X3's "zero synchronization calls in the layer loop" still holds,
//    and it costs 0.021 ms.
//
// 2. **A GRAPH RE-READS ITS INPUT BUFFERS AT REPLAY, BUT NOT ITS KERNEL ARGUMENTS.**  Verified: eight
//    replays with a different pinned input each time all tracked correctly, so the data path is live; but a
//    kernel argument is copied into the node at capture and is never re-read.  **Anything that changes per
//    step - a position, a page-table base, a token id - must be DATA in a device buffer, never an argument.**
//    This is the phase's "graph capture with pointers that change between steps silently replays stale
//    addresses" hazard, and it now has a measurement behind it.
//
// 3. **FIXED ADDRESSES ARE THE CALLER'S OBLIGATION.**  The registry cannot check them.  Every buffer a
//    captured body touches must be allocated before `record` and never reallocated; the registry holds the
//    graph, not the memory.
//
// What the registry is FOR: a layer's ops are the same every token, so recording them once and replaying
// removes the per-call host cost of submitting them individually.  Measured, that cost is 10-22 us PER CALL
// into the driver on this machine, and a layer with 8 submissions is ~0.1 ms of round trip.
