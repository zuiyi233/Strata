// include/strata/kernels/bf16_bits.hpp - the bf16 conversions, written out, as bits.
//
// bf16 is the TOP HALF of an f32, so `f32_from_bf16` is a shift and needs no rounding at all.  The forward
// direction does: ggml's `ggml_compute_fp32_to_bf16` adds `((i >> 16) & 1) + 0x7FFF` and truncates 16 bits.
//
// **THE `& 1` IS ON BIT 16**, the lowest KEPT bit, which is what makes an exact tie round to EVEN.  Using bit
// 15 there is a plausible mistake: it differs only on exact ties, i.e. almost never on real data, which is
// exactly why it would survive any amount of end-to-end testing.  `ref/quant.py` documents the same rule for
// the same reason.
//
// WHY THIS IS SEPARATE FROM `f16_bits.hpp`: fp16 and bf16 are not two spellings of one idea.  fp16 has 5
// exponent bits and 10 mantissa bits; bf16 has 8 and 7.  A conversion routine written for one and reused for
// the other is wrong in a way that produces plausible numbers - bf16's 2^-9 relative precision looks like a
// small fp16 error and is not small at all next to fp16's 2^-11.
//
// `gr.cu` carried a private copy of `f32_to_bf16_bits` until this header existed.  It now includes this.
