// include/strata/sycl_doorbell.hpp - the SYCL port: host<->device flag traffic that must bypass the GPU's caches.
//
// Strata's decode loop is a handshake through host-mapped memory: the GPU rings a sequence number the host polls,
// and a one-thread kernel spins on a flag the host writes. In CUDA those are `volatile` loads and stores, which
// nvcc turns into cache-bypassing accesses. A `volatile` in SYCL device code carries no such meaning on Intel
// GPUs: the spin read its first value from L3 forever (measured: the GPU at 100% and the host seeing no ring).
// Atomic loads and stores with system scope are the accesses that go to memory, so every side of the handshake
// goes through these two.

// Every device spin is bounded. An unbounded spin that never sees its flag is not a hang of one process: the
// xe driver times the queue out, resets the GT node by node (a window graph has 2,366 of them), and the card
// stays wedged until a reboot - measured twice. With a bound the failure is a wrong window instead, which the
// verifier's checks catch. ~2 M host-memory reads is a few seconds at PCIe latency.
