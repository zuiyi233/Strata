"""tools/make_profile.py - the expert-cache profile (`data/expert-profile.bin`): every (layer, expert) pair, ranked.

`--expert-cache auto` fills the VRAM slots it can afford with the profile's pairs in order, so the ranking decides
which experts start resident (the adaptive tier then swaps in what a conversation routes most).  A profile that
ranks fewer pairs than a card can hold caps the cache (issue #46: a 32 GB card stopped at 8,000 slots); this tool
writes one that ranks all 24,576.

The order: the base profile's ranking (default: the shipped data/expert-profile.bin), then the pairs your routing
traces used, most frequent first, then every pair still missing, interleaved across the layers.

WATCH THE BASE: `take()` skips a pair it has already ranked, and the shipped base ranks all 24,576, so with the
default `--base` NO trace can ever move a pair - the run prints "0 from the traces" and the output is the base
again.  Pass `--no-base` (rank by the traces alone, then fill) when you mean to re-rank for your own traffic.
That the profile in use is the shipped ordering and not this model's is not cosmetic: the layer-split cost model
reads a RANKING as if it were a frequency curve, and `predict` in src/program/generate.cpp carries the measured
hit rates that say how far off that goes (94.9% claimed against 69.2% measured at 5,805 pairs held).

    python tools/make_profile.py [TRACE ...] [--base data/expert-profile.bin | --no-base] [--out PATH]
                                 [--n-expert 256]      (a pruned model: GSQ-RCO Coder keeps 256 of 512)

A routing trace comes from a one-shot engine run with `--dump-routing FILE` (a prompt typical of your use; the
routed experts of every layer and position are written).  Point the model config's `--expert-profile` at the result.
