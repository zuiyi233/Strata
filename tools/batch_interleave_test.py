"""Batch slots, the parts batch_test.py does not reach (#465): a long prompt read WHILE other slots decode (its
chunks interleaved with their windows), and a conversation's next turn continued from the slot that holds it.

  1. solo references (GEN): A, then A's next turn (from the live session), B, C (a long prompt)
  2. the same in the slots: A in slot 0, B in slot 1 next to it, then C in slot 2 while A and B decode - every slot's
     tokens must equal its solo tokens
  3. A's next turn (BGEN into slot 0, which still holds A): read from the slot, its tokens must equal the solo next turn
  4. a long prompt D gives way (BYIELD) at its first chunk boundary, a short E is admitted, D goes on from its slot
     while E decodes: both equal their solo tokens
  6. A in a slot, stopped after 50 tokens and continued on the solo path (GEN of A + its tokens, from the slot): the
     whole equals solo A (what the server does with a request left alone in a slot)
  5. (a measurement) a solo next turn continued from a slot: the drafts accepted
  7. F, A's history as a client sends it back without the reply's thinking, from slot 1's turn checkpoint: equal to
     F solo (which continues from the same checkpoint of the live chain)

Exact comparisons need the same settings as batch_test.py (this script sets STRATA_IQ_MT_MIN=1):
  python tools/batch_interleave_test.py --exe build/strata --config strata-<model>.json \\
      --extra "--pcie-frac 0 --adapt-every 1000000 --no-prefill-borrow"
Without --no-prefill-borrow the slots decoding during C's read see the expert cache without the slots C's prompt
borrowed (those experts run on the CPU, which rounds differently): A's and B's text may then drift from solo.
