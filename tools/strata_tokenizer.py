"""tools/strata_tokenizer.py - the tokenizer, as the reference implementation of record.

WHY THIS EXISTS AND WHERE IT SITS.  The GGUF carries the whole tokenizer in metadata: `tokenizer.ggml.model`
= `gpt2`, 248,320 `tokens`, 247,587 `merges`, `token_type`, `pre` = `qwen35`, and a Jinja `chat_template`.
None of that needs the 35 GB of weights, so it is extracted into the pack's `tokenizer/` directory
(docs/pack-format.md §6) and this module is what reads it back.  A C++ port follows and is tested against
this one.

THE DECISIVE PROPERTY IS THE ROUND TRIP.  Byte-level BPE maps each BYTE to a printable unicode character so
that any UTF-8 input is representable with no UNK token.  Every failure mode of that mapping - the wrong
offset for a byte, a merge applied in the wrong order, a pre-tokenizer split that drops a character - still
produces plausible token ids.  `decode(encode(s)) == s` is the check that sees them, and it is exact because
the byte layer is lossless.  It is asserted over a corpus chosen to hit the boundaries: multi-byte UTF-8,
emoji (4-byte), combining marks, whitespace runs, and C0 control bytes.

class PromptEncoder:
    """`tok.encode(text, parse_special=True)` for chat prompts, reusing the ids of an earlier prompt.

    A chat client sends the whole conversation every turn, and the rendered prompt of turn n+1 starts with most of
    turn n's.  Running BPE over all of it again costs hundreds of milliseconds at 100K tokens, even when the engine
    reuses the whole prefix.  So the ids up to a SPECIAL-TOKEN BOUNDARY both prompts share are taken as they were,
    and only the rest is encoded.

    WHY THAT IS EXACT.  Encoding splits the text at special-token matches and BPE-encodes each stretch between two
    matches on its own (`_encode_matching`): nothing crosses a match.  Whether a match starts at position q depends
    only on text[q : q + max_special_len].  So if the two texts agree up to L, every decision the scan makes at a
    position before c = the end of some match, with c + max_special_len - 1 <= L, is the same for both - the same
    matches, the same stretches, the same ids up to c - and from c the scan starts afresh, exactly as it does on
    text[c:].  Hence encode(new) == ids_old[:ids at c] + encode(new[c:]).  The margin matters only for a
    vocabulary where a literal overlaps another's end; it costs re-encoding one short stretch.

    A few recent prompts are kept (one per conversation: the one a prompt extends is replaced by it), so a second
