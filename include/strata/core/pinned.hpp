// include/strata/core/pinned.hpp - P2.S1: the host arena the expert weights live in.
//
// 33.97 GB of expert weights cannot fit in a 12 GB card, so they stay in host memory and are streamed.  That
// makes this arena the engine's real working set: it must be PAGE-LOCKED for the copy engine to reach full
// bandwidth, and it must say which backing it got, because the two options differ by more than twice in TLB
// reach:
//
//   * LARGE PAGES (2 MB) - `mmap(MAP_HUGETLB)` / hugetlbfs on Linux, `VirtualAlloc(MEM_LARGE_PAGES)` on
//     Windows.  33.97 GB at 4 KB pages is 8.3 million TLB entries, which does not fit in any TLB, so every
//     block of every expert matvec takes TLB misses.
//   * NORMAL PAGES - the fallback.  Correct, slower, and it must be REPORTED rather than silently accepted:
//     "the engine adapts to the machine it is on" is only true if the engine says what it got.  On Windows
//     large pages additionally need SeLockMemoryPrivilege, which a normal user account does not have, so this
//     fallback is the common case and not an error path.
