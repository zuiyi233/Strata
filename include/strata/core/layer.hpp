// include/strata/core/layer.hpp - one GDN LAYER, composed.  P2.S5's mixer.
//
// This is the first place in the engine where the kernels are COMPOSED rather than tested individually, so
// the thing it has to get right is the ORDER and the buffers, not the arithmetic.  Every kernel it calls is
// parity-tested on its own; what can go wrong here is a buffer sized for the wrong shape, a step done in the
// wrong order, or a value that should have been converted and was not.
//
// `ref/gdn.py::gdn_decode` is the specification, and the order below is its docstring verbatim:
//
//     qkv  = wqkv @ x                     (10240 = q|k|v, each a contiguous run of 128-wide heads)
//     conv -> SiLU                        (SiLU is applied to the WHOLE conv output before the split)
//     q,k  = l2_norm                      (v is NOT normalised)
//     beta = sigmoid(wbeta @ x)
//     gate = softplus(walpha @ x + dt) * ssm_a
//     recurrent step
//     y    = rms_norm(o, ssm_norm) * sigmoid(z)      <- SIGMOID for qwen4exp; qwen3.5 used SiLU
//     out  = ssm_out @ y
//
// FOUR THINGS IN THAT ORDER ARE EASY TO READ PAST, and each produces a plausible number:
//
//   * **SiLU is applied BEFORE the split**, to the whole 10240-wide conv output.  Applying it only to q and
//     k, or after the reshape, is the same arithmetic on different data.
//   * **v is NOT normalised.** `l2_norm` applies to q and k only - two rows of 16 heads, not the 48 of v.
//   * **the `/hc`-style scale on q is `1/sqrt(S)`**, applied by the CALLER because `ref/gdn.py` says the two
//     llama.cpp paths apply it in different places.  It goes on AFTER the norm.
//   * **the state is transposed** relative to the reference: (S, h_v, S) here, (S, S, h_v) there.  That is
//     `gdn.hpp`'s choice and it is the reason `gdn_step`'s arguments are laid out as they are.
//
// THE ACTIVATIONS FOLLOW THE CONTRACT, which is why three different GEMVs appear below: `attn_qkv`,
// `attn_gate` and `ssm_out` are K-quants (Q8_K), while `ssm_alpha` and `ssm_beta` are BF16 (bf16).  Using one
// activation format for all five would be a 0.66-1.41% error on the three that matter - measured, in
// `s_gemv_q8k_parity` and `bf16_gemv_parity`.

// ================================ THE MOE, SPLIT AT THE ROUTER ================================
//
// **THE SPLIT EXISTS BECAUSE THE ONE-LAYER DELAY WAS NOT A TIMING CHANGE.**  `moe_layer` is
// `route -> publish -> shared expert -> combine`, and `combine` multiplies `parts` by THIS layer's
// `b.weights`.  So `parts` must be THIS layer's expert outputs.  A host loop that hands layer `l`'s pool
// result to layer `l+1` computes `sum_j w_{l+1}[j] * expert_{ids_l,j}(x_l)` while the model is
// `sum_j w_l[j] * expert_{ids_l,j}(x_l)` - **both the expert selection and the input one layer stale while the
// weights are current** - and `session.hpp` states the contract it violates: the doorbell is "a change to WHEN
// the host runs, not to what this function computes".
//
// The one-layer delay was introduced for a real reason - it is the only way to overlap a CPU pool with a GPU
// that has already queued the combine - and the fix is to split the GRAPH, not to delay the answer:
//
//     block_layer_pre[l]   attn -> mixer -> gr_write -> ffn gr_read -> moe_route   [rings the doorbell]
//     ... the host runs the pool here, on the ids `moe_route` just published ...
//     block_layer_post[l]  moe_finish -> gr_write
//
// `post[l]` is launched AFTER the pool returns, so it sees layer `l`'s experts with layer `l`'s weights, and it
// is still a captured graph.  What it costs is the overlap: the window is now whatever GPU work follows the
// ring inside `pre[l]` - the shared expert and nothing else, because everything after the combine depends on
// `parts`.  **A per-layer CPU pool cannot be hidden behind a strictly serial residual chain**, which is why
// Phase 3's VRAM expert cache is the answer to the CPU term and the doorbell is not.
