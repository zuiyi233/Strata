// include/strata/core/expert_source.hpp - P2.S3/P2.S5: the expert pool's adapter to the host loop.
//
// `session_loop` publishes, per layer, the NORMED activation `x_f`, the ten routed expert ids and their router
// weights, and expects `k x n_embd` floats back.  This is the piece that turns those four things into an
// `ExpertPool::run` call.  Nothing here is clever, and that is the point: the pool, the kernel and the loop are
// each already verified, so this file has exactly one job - get the CONTRACT between them right.
//
// THE CONTRACT, and each clause is a way to be wrong:
//
//   1. **`x_f` IS THE SAME PINNED BUFFER EVERY LAYER.**  Its ADDRESS never changes, so the `ActQ` cannot be
//      cached by pointer - a cache keyed on `x_f` would quantize layer 0 and reuse it for all 47 remaining
//      layers, which is a finite, plausible, completely wrong token.  There is no cache here at all: the
//      conversion is one 2560-element pass against a 0.3 ms/layer budget, and a correct answer is worth more
//      than the microseconds.
//   2. **THE POOL DOES NOT APPLY THE ROUTER WEIGHT.**  `moe_combine` (`src/core/layer.cpp:479`) sums
//      `w[i] * parts[i]` on the device.  `ExpertJob::weight` is a diagnostic field; setting it here would
//      apply the weight twice, which is invisible in a single layer and compounds over 48.
//   3. **THE KERNEL'S GEOMETRY IS FIXED BY THE ARTIFACT** (`H = 2560`, `FF = 640`, `BLOB = 1,382,400`).  A
//      different `n_embd` or a different expert width is REFUSED rather than mis-indexed, because the blob's
//      internal offsets are compile-time constants and reading a 640-wide expert as a 2560-wide one walks off
//      the end into the next expert's bytes without faulting.
