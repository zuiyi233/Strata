// include/strata/core/weights.hpp - the dense weights, loaded into VRAM in ENGINE form.
//
// The pack is the ARTIFACT's business; this is the ENGINE's.  The differences are deliberate, and they run in
// BOTH directions:
//
//   * SHRINKING.  A tensor whose source type is BF16 is stored in the pack promoted to 32 bits, because that is
//     lossless and it keeps the canonical decoder simple, but a running engine re-rounds it to 16 - which costs
//     nothing at all, because the value CAME from 16 bits.  Per `tools/pack_budget.py` that saving is the
//     difference between the dense weights fitting in VRAM beside the expert cache and not fitting at all.
//
//   * GROWING.  90 of the 303 quantized tensors carry fp16 SCALES in the pack (all 58 Q2_0 expert tensors, plus
//     Q4_0, Q5_0, Q8_0 and IQ4_NL) because that is what the source block holds.  Every kernel here takes
//     `const float* scales`, and fp16 is a subset of f32, so this loader WIDENS them - exactly, changing no
//     value - for 11,407,360 B.  See `docs/pack-format.md` Â§2.4; assuming 4 bytes per scale instead of reading
//     `scales_fp16` is what made the plane arithmetic disagree with the pack for a whole round.
//
//     pack      5.305 GiB dense + 0.444 GiB embd
//     engine    4.067 GiB dense + 0.444 GiB embd + 10.88 MiB widened scales = 4.522 GiB
//
// WHAT THE LOADER DOES NOT DO: it does not know what any tensor MEANS.  It reads a flat index
// (`<pack>/index.txt`, written by `tools/pack_index.py`), copies each tensor into one arena at a recorded
// offset - as a list of PLANE SEGMENTS, because a scale plane can change width and the rest cannot - and hands
// back a name -> WeightRef map.  Geometry, forms and semantics belong to the caller.
//
// WHY AN INDEX FILE AND NOT A JSON PARSER: a JSON parser in the engine would be a new, unaudited component
// whose failure mode is a wrong byte offset - which decodes to a plausible weight and produces plausible
// logits.  Python wrote the manifest and already parses it correctly.
