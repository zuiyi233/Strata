// include/strata/core/expert_cache.hpp - R4: the VRAM-resident expert tier.
//
// **WHY THIS EXISTS, IN ONE PARAGRAPH.** The CPU expert pool is the engine's largest single cost: measured,
// **663.6 MB of expert bytes per token at ~40 GB/s = 16.2 ms**, on a token of ~53 ms, and `test_expert_pool`
// says the pipeline hides **1.055 ms of 19.035** - the CPU work is 96% exposed because the residual chain is
// strictly serial. The only way past it is to stop reading those bytes: put some of the 48 x 512 experts in
// VRAM and let the GPU compute them, so the CPU reads only the misses.
//
// **THE DESIGN IS SIZED AGAINST MEASUREMENTS, NOT AGAINST THE PLAN'S ASSUMPTIONS.**
//
//   * `h_expert` at 4,105 slots, **ten-fold leave-one-out: 0.6447 [0.6110, 0.6750]** (`tools/routing_kfold.py`).
//     The 0.6573 the README published is in-sample and 0.4720 measured a single-prompt CORPUS, not the metric.
//   * VRAM, measured on a live run rather than at startup: **6414 MiB free** with the engine at steady state,
//     against **5413 MiB** for 4,105 slots. It fits, with ~1 GB spare. `strata-device`'s planner agrees and says
//     FITS, but the planner runs before the dense arena exists, so the live figure is the one that counts.
//   * `h_layer` held-out is **0.0456** - only 4.6% of (layer, token) pairs have all ten experts resident - so
//     this cannot be a per-layer grouped kernel and the three-way split is not an optimisation.
//
// **WHAT THIS FILE IS.** The SLOT STORAGE and the RESIDENCY TABLE: it allocates the VRAM, fills it from the host
// arena, and answers `(layer, expert) -> slot or -1`. It computes nothing itself: the GPU computes the experts it
// holds in the verify window's grouped kernels and the prompt path (the hit/miss split), and the CPU pool the rest.
// (Written when nothing consumed the slots yet and `--expert-cache` defaulted to 0; setup's configs use `auto`.)
