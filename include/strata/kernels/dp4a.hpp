// include/strata/kernels/dp4a.hpp - the two instructions the kernels use that Pascal (sm_60) does not have.
//
// The engine is written for compute capability 7.5 and newer and refuses older cards at CMake configure time
// (a Pascal build passes -DSTRATA_EXPERIMENTAL_SM60=ON).  A GP100-class card is compute capability 6.0, which is
// missing exactly two things the i-quant kernels rely on:
//
//   * `__dp4a`, a byte-wise dot product, available from 6.1 (Pascal GP10x/GV11x).  Its fallback below is
//     llama.cpp's own (`ggml/src/ggml-cuda/common.cuh`), which is the reference for the kernels in this
//     directory: they are transcribed from llama.cpp's vecdotq.cuh, and that wrapper's operands are the same
//     sites.  It reinterprets the operands as SIGNED bytes and accumulates in int32, which is what `__dp4a`
//     does for these calls, so the fallback is bit-exact rather than merely close.
//   * `__nanosleep`, available from 7.0 (Volta).  It only paces single-thread doorbell waits, so a loop that
//     spins without it is correct, merely busier.
//
// Both are compile-time selections on `__CUDA_ARCH__`, so one source tree builds for Pascal and for RTX
// 20/30/40/50 without a #define at the call sites.  A HIP build never takes either fallback: `__CUDA_ARCH__` is
// undefined there, so `STRATA_DP4A` is `__dp4a` (which `hip_compat/intrinsics.hpp` provides) and the pause is
// HIP's own `__nanosleep`.
