// include/strata/kernels/elementwise.hpp - the small ops a LAYER needs between its GEMVs, P2.S5.
//
// These are not interesting kernels and that is why they are in one file with one parity test: they are the
// glue in the per-layer graph, and glue that is written inline at each call site is glue with several
// slightly different float conventions.  Three of them exist because a projection returns a DIFFERENT
// quantity from the one the next kernel wants:
//
//   * `gdn_gate` turns (alpha, dt, ssm_a) into the recurrence's `gate`.  `ref/gdn.py` L265:
//     `gate = softplus(w_alpha . x + dt) * ssm_a`, with `softplus(x) = log1p(exp(x))` and the large-x branch
//     `ggml_compute_softplus_f32` uses.  `ssm_a` is NEGATIVE, which is what puts `exp(gate)` in (0,1).
//   * `scale_inplace` applies the delta net's `1/sqrt(S)` to q.  It is a separate op because
//     `ref/gdn.py` says the two llama.cpp paths apply it in DIFFERENT places, so the caller has to own the
//     choice rather than have it buried in a kernel.
//   * `f32_to_f16_bulk` is what lets the f32 arithmetic of the mixer feed the fp16-activation GEMVs.
//     `docs/activation-contract.md` is explicit that this is NOT the contract for a quantized weight - it is
//     the bridge between two stages that both already exist, and the contract decision is a separate one.
//
// `silu_inplace` is here because `shared_expert` has its own copy inline and `gdn` needs one for the conv
// output; a third copy would be two too many.
