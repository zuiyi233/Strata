// include/strata/kernels/kv_stream.hpp - KV streaming for the QSA layers (docs/kv-streaming-design.md).
//
// A streamed QSA layer keeps its AUTHORITATIVE K/V in pinned, device-mapped host memory, laid out exactly as a
// fully resident pool with the identity page table would be. VRAM holds a pool of `n_slots` pages (one page =
// `page_size` = 4 cells = one indexer block, all KV heads, K and V: 4,224 B in int8), and the page table becomes a
// RESIDENCY MAP: `page_table[block]` is the slot holding that block, or -1.
//
// Every reader (`qsa_decode_attn_*`, `kv_gather_*`) is unchanged: it goes through the page table as before. What
// changes is that after the selection and before the attention, `kv_stream_resolve` makes every block the
// selection names resident - on device, inside the captured graphs:
//   1. one block of 1,024 threads walks the selected ids: a resident block gets this call's epoch and its clock
//      reference bit, a missing block is claimed once (page_table -1 -> -2) into a miss list;
//   2. the same block picks one victim slot per miss with a CLOCK sweep (second chance) that never takes a slot
//      this call uses, re-points the page table (old block -> -1, new block -> slot);
//   3. a copy kernel reads the missed blocks from the host copy (zero-copy, over PCIe) into their slots.
// Writers (`kv_append_*`) write the host copy always, and the slot only if the block is resident, so the slots
// never go stale and nothing needs invalidating - not after a rejected draft, not on a conversation-cache resume.
//
// A RING (the MTP drafter, which only ever reads its last `window` cells) uses the same host copy with a static
// table `block -> block % n_slots` and no resolve: the ring is refilled from the host copy on a resume.
