// include/strata/kernels/qsa_select.hpp - plan v0.3 P5/P7: the QSA indexer's block scores and top-k selection,
// for many queries at once and at long context.
//
// The per-token path scores every pooled block with one FP64 block per row (qsa_index_kernel) and selects with a
// single-block kernel that makes 32 bit-serial passes over every CELL (topk_kernel): ~0.1-0.2 ms per query at 32K,
// once per QSA layer and token - 1-2 ms of a decode token and most of a 32K prompt's time.  Here:
//
//   qsa_block_scores : one warp per (query, block), FP32; relu per indexer head, summed; block n_bid (the
//                      incomplete tail) scores the `dead` key and gets +1e9 when it has cells - which is exactly
//                      what the per-token path reads there, because pooled[n_bid] holds `dead` at that time (in
//                      a chunk it may already hold a block completed later, so it is not read).
//   qsa_block_topk   : one block per query; a 4-pass radix select over the query's n_bid + 1 blocks, each
//                      weighted by its cell count, then the cells emitted in ascending order with ties to the
//                      lowest index - the same selection as topk_kernel, over a quarter of the elements.  On sm_90+
//                      a call of up to 16 queries runs it on a cluster of 8 CTAs per query: the same ids.
//
// Queries carry their own step record (pos, n_kv, n_bid, width) as everywhere else in QSA.
