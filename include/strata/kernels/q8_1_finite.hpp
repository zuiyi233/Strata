// include/strata/kernels/q8_1_finite.hpp - #606: the q8_1 activation block's scale and sum, kept finite.
//
// A q8_1 block stores its scale d = amax / 127 and the sum of its 32 raw activations as fp16. A sum past 65504 (one
// massive-activation dimension among 32 values is enough) rounds to inf, and d does past amax = 8.3M; the dot
// products then read inf * 0 = NaN, and a NaN in the residual ends as one token repeated (ggml-org/llama.cpp#23606
// is the same defect). Clamped to the largest finite half, such a block gives an approximate product instead of NaN,
// and the values are held to the int8 range they then exceed. Every block that was finite before is stored bit for
// bit as before: values in (65504, 65520) round to 65504 anyway, and a finite block's |x / d| is at most 127. A NaN
// stays NaN (the comparisons are false for it), so STRATA_DBG_NAN still sees one.
