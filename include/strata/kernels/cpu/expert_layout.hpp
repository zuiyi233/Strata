// include/strata/kernels/cpu/expert_layout.hpp - plan v0.3 P6: where each routed expert lives in experts.bin.
//
// A Q2_0 pack (tools/strata_pack.py) has one blob size for every layer, `BLOB`, in the Strata expert form.  A
// native pack (tools/iq_pack.py, the IQ2_XS / IQ3_XXS files) keeps each expert's raw GGUF slices, so the blob
// size and the formats change from layer to layer; `native_experts.txt` says how.  Everything that touches an
// expert blob - the arena, the VRAM tier, the prompt path, the CPU pool, the GPU window - asks this table.
