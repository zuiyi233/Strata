// include/strata/kernels/bf16_gemv.hpp - the GEMV for a BF16 weight, P2.S5.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS WHEN `s_gemv` ALREADY DOES.  `s_gemv` decodes the S-family canonical forms (S2/S4/S8) from
// `codes` + `scales`, and a BF16 weight is not one of them - it has no codes and no scales, it is a plain
// 16-bit matrix.  Six tensors per layer are in that state:
//
//     ssm_alpha.weight, ssm_beta.weight                 GDN,  [n_embd, 48]
//     indexer.q_proj.weight, indexer.k_proj.weight      QSA,  [n_embd, 512] and [n_embd, 128]
//     ple_value.weight                                  layer 1, [n_embd, n_embd]
//     ffn_gate_inp.weight                               handled inside `router_top10`
//
// The original entry points take BF16 activation bits for the historical CPU-derived contract. The explicit
// FP32 entry point below follows the pinned CUDA single-token MMVF contract. See docs/activation-contract.md
// for why activation precision depends on backend and batch geometry rather than weight type alone.
